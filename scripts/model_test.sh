TEXT="Beyond the typical limitations of this kind of research—such as the divergence between human and model learning mechanisms, or the complexity of real-world language acquisition—another potential limitation is that the intuition-led experimental designs may obscure the true causes of generalization. In current practice, hypotheses are often derived directly from prior linguistic researches. For example, in this paper, the authors preselect two factors—frequency and lexical semantics—as candidate explanations for why some verbs show passivization. While this approach allows for targeted causal testing, it risks overlooking deeper or latent explanatory variables. For example, the observed correlation between verb frequency and passivizability might actually reflect a more fundamental property, like pre-emption mentioned in 8.4. The paper’s own findings also suggest that neither factor alone fully accounts for model behavior.

One potential alternative is to adopt a clustering-based approach grounded in naturalistic data. Instead of starting with pre-selected hypotheses or factors, researchers can first construct or sample a large and diverse set of real language environments in which target verbs appear. By evaluating the model’s generalization behavior—e.g., how acceptable it finds the passive form of each verb in different contexts—these environments can then be clustered based on the model’s responses. In this approach, researchers may discover more emergent and basic drivers of generalization that may not have been anticipated by linguistics before, and use these insights to guide further experiments, including those with human learners.

Admittedly, this approach is difficult under the current experimental framework, where each condition requires retraining a model from scratch, making large-scale exploration impractical. However, if we have a more efficient framework in the future, like using probing methods, we may reduce evaluation costs and shift away from intuition-led designs, allowing the model itself to reveal what it has learned and how it generalizes."
