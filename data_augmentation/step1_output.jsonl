This includes superior, but they will not neccesarily be superior after imbuing (they get random base-modifications). Bloodfist and Gorefoot are both uniques (gold), and therefore not eligible for imbuing.\nWhen you imbue, the item level matters (the item level is hidden). The item is the same level as the monster who dropped it. That means, that the higher level the monster who dropped it, the more stats is available on that item. It is important to note that an item doesn't neccesarily use all it's stat potential. This means that the same item dropped in a1 and a2 can has the possibility of some very different outcomes.\nAfter the imbue, the item can be as good as if the monster itself had dropped a rare (yellow) item.

{"input_text": "While I don't much support the term noob per se, I think the most useful definition of a player is their ability to understand and work in the team dynamic to push for victory. There are two main lessons a player must learn, and a bunch of secondary ones that stem from that. \n Lesson 1: Play Well Individually \n This is mostly the obvious part. If you're playing a sniper, get headshots, deal with counter sniping, and so on. Each class has their own foibles and learning curve. Engineer is probably the best class for the 'rote' aspects of this, as much of their early game strategy basically comes down to building perfectly at an optimal speed, like getting the sentry and dispenser up by the main spawn to cover the courtyard and both forward entries ASAP on round start. Other classes are more implicit, like knowing how to use the maps for scouts, spies, and soldiers. Knowing how to set an effective sticky trap. \n You may not necessarily be great at a given class, but you migrate out of 'noob' territory in my book when it's clear your play mistakes are incidental rather than systemic. Got killed by a random enemy poking around a corner? Not a noob error. Missed a clutch shot and died in an important firefight? Happens to the best of us. Over-extend into a front line? Probably a noob mistake. \n Lesson 2: Play Your Team \n One thing I find really frustrating on many pub servers is that most people never really seem to get the idea of working together as a team. All classes have their strengths and weaknesses, and while you can go far on your own personal skill, the force multiplication of a coordinated effort is so huge that on pubs it is usually more important than skill unless it's entirely lopsided. \n Obvious things are like picking classes that cover where the team is weak. There's also more subtle stuff, like if you have an engineer building a forward base, help guard the zone for a few seconds if you don't have an immediate priority target to reach. Understanding the dynamics of timing and supporting the moves your allies make is a gigantic step out of noobdom. See an uber? Follow it. Know a spy's getting in position to sap? Try to pull attention. \n At a higher level of play, you can begin to perform some actions that would normally be somewhat noobish with deeper thought and skill in mind to achieve a bigger goal. For example, you're a scout and can afford to break ahead of your team's push of the fourth point, and the fifth is clear. But the other team is moving as a squad back to the other point. Do you cap or harass? This is a complex question, but there are times when the right answer is to run through their team to try and force a medic kill or at least slow their push enough to get the cap and give the rest of your team spare moments to reload for the fight.", "pseudo_summary_extractive": "While I do n't much support the term noob se , I think the useful definition of is ability.

{"input_text": "I have one very distinct memory of bad saves. In Final Fantasy Tactics, there's a boss encounter about 3/4ths of the way through the game that you have to fight with only your main character. It's at the end of a series of battles, meaning you can't move through the world map between them. The first time I ever played the game I got stuck here, I hadn't been staggering my saves, and saved over my only slot right after the first battle. I wasn't strong enough to defeat the boss and got stuck. I ended up having to restart from the beginning to beat him. \n Fast forward to Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions on the PSP. I was well aware of the boss, but I wasn't sure where. I had staggered saves and I was making sure that I always had a backup save.

{"input_text": "Not sure if this change has been seriously discussed here but I think this is gonna be the biggest, most unbalancing change in PvP in 1.4. For the most part I liked the changes Bioware made to the other classes. Commandos & Sages got buffs where they needed it, DPS Scoundrels got some love (though still not enough imo), and I'm even fine with the Assault Vanguard nerfs to be honest. But the buff to Focus spec baffled me for the longest time when I read it. I think if anything, most heavy PvPers (including Focus spec players) were expecting it to be hit with a nerf 1.4, instead it's the other way around. \n Everyone knows Focus Guardians (and to a lesser extent Sentinels) do the expected insane amounts of total damage (AOE spec, no big surprise) but what's crazy is that they'll often also have the biggest single hit in warzones, because of the way they can Force Stasis/Choke (skill tree node) and Leap in (Vindicator set bonus) to get extra damage + guaranteed crit (skill tree node). I'm fully augmented WH with optimized mods/enhancements and I'm lucky to hit 5.5k against BM and above opponents. I've screenshots of Guardians doing up to 6.7k in those same warzones while also surpassing me in total damage. And Bioware is buffing them so they can Smash even  more  often? \n It wasn't until I talked to a friend who does PvE (which I almost never do) that he explained it's a PvE buff. Focus spec lags super hard (around 15-20% according to DPS parsers) behind Vigilance for Guardians and the other 2 DPS trees for Sentinels in PvE. So they upping the frequency of Sweep to make up for this. \n Here's where I see 2 problems: \n 1) I doubt this is even gonna fix the PvE issue. A big part of Focus specs problem in PvE is the fact it's AOE and it'll wake up and hit all CC'd targets along with taking threat away from the tank that the tank might not have heavily taunted/attacked at that point. I have a feeling most dedicated PvErs are still gonna stick with the other specs because it's safer and does damage just fine. \n 2) I understand in PvE, Focus spec is underwhelming against a boss with 500k - 1mill-k HP. The sustain just isn't there (pre 1.4). But in PvP burst is king and against players with 15k-20k health, hitting for 5k-6.5k damage every 15 seconds against everybody around them is VERY VERY GOOD. And now it's gonna get even better. \n I'm just gonna go out on a limb and say next few weeks Warzones are gonna be a bit rough when more and more ppl realize how strong Focus spec is post 1.4 and until it becomes an obvious enough issue that Bioware needs to balance patch this.", "pseudo_summary_extractive": "Not sure discussed but I think gon.

I won't advocate changing yourself to her expectations because I think her expectations do not take you into account either.  I think both of you would be better off with more compatible people. \n I use drugs a lot like you do.  I'm not opposed to a bump of coke or two a couple times a year when it's around, I'll eat some mushrooms on a camping trip in the woods every couple years or so for a good cerebral dump and wipe, I smoke marijuana fairly regularly it's a good way to unwind with a beer at the end of the day, I drink beer and have begun brewing my own because it's a fun hobby, and I enjoy smoking cigars with my dad or my uncles when we have time to visit.  My girlfriend and I live together and I've never pushed anything on her.  She is aware of how I take my pleasure by the dose sometimes.  She enjoys beer, and has taken an interest in brewing so we have a shared hobby, and the occasional toke, but has no interest in other drugs.  I don't need her to take drugs to validate myself, and she doesn't require me to abstain to appease her own self-interest.  We are compatible and sensible with each other.  This is how we are and I wouldn't change her, and she doesn't need to change me. \n However I have a problem with your story.  Why do you feel the need to validate yourself by pressuring her to use these substances the way you do?  It's obvious she has no interest.  On the other hand she is asking the same of you from a different perspective, that you abstain like her.  It's obvious you have no interest to change either. \n There's your answer, staring you right in the face.  If you have experienced such incompatibility on such regular intervals over the same issue which neither of you have an interest in changing, then stop beating yourself up.  Give up on this rollercoaster because it is emotionally draining and hurtful for both of you.  You are young, probably intelligent, and have a lot of time ahead of you.  Learn from this and be yourself.  You are yourself, she is herself, and if either has to change to fit the other's expectations, when these expectations are unreal, then be yourself by yourself and not what she wants you to be.  I don't think you're going to be able to compromise with your current attitude about drugs.  You need to find somebody less hung up on your drug use, and you also need to reexamine why you need her so badly to \"try before you say no\" to validate your own use.

{"input_text": "I'm warning for a wall of text here. \n Actually there's quite a good explanation for this phenomenon. This is what we in marketing call branding. That is the creation of a brand. A brand in turn is \"A person, name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers.\" This is according to the american marketing association. Now in this case it has to do with personal branding. \n Rein, Kotler and Stoller (1987) define a celebrity as as ”A person whose name has attention-getting, interest-riveting, profit generating value”. By using a celebrity for endorsement in campaigns you can achieve something called co-branding. That means that the name of a celebrity is used to endorse a particular politician or party. This is the same as what Nike for example does with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods for example. They use their names, big names in their particular fields, to endorse endorse different kinds of products to give them more exposure. \n Say that you want to sell a shoe. If you see two ads, one with just the shoe and one with Michael Jordan (or whatever celebrity you know of) you are by more or less always going to pay more attention to the one with the celebrity. \n Alright so now we've covered the basics. Now we are coming to word of mouth or as we are here online we are talking about word of mouse. Because of the nature of politics, by that I mean that it's an area which very few people actually know that much about and the information can be ambiguous, they look to so called opinion leaders. These opinion leaders can be more or less anyone. For example Steven Colbert, Bill O'Riley,Engadget, Ray W Johnson or what ever ... someone people look to for some kind of information they are too lazy to find out themselves and which give them the information they think they need. \n Now say that you know jack shit about politics and you are ha huge fan of Madonna, then you'll most probably think that Madonna probably is on to something. So instead of finding stuff out yourself you vote like Madonna, because you \"know\" Madonna and you like her, so she's probably right. That means that Madonna is your opinion leader in this case.

I have considerable experience with coding  real  world applications (in customer's hands) for many-core (single die) architectures at this scale and [much] larger. I also write compilers for them. Could you give us an estimate of your current fetch/ALU ratio? \n For those who don't know about these devices, let me put it into GPU terms (SIMT only; SIMD is much, much harder to analyze): fetch would correspond to a texture sample, ALU is the work done on the sample. If the arch's fetch/ALU ratio is 1:4, then you need 4 (pure, non loading) arithmetic operations per memory request to keep the part \"fed\". A ratio as low as 1:4 is only really possible with low clock rate/memory rate ratio, and (nearly pure) SIMT. For instance, a large RT pixel shader on a Radeon 5870 would have numbers like this. \n SIMT means \"single instruction multiple thread\" and refers to totally non-communicating processes. SIMD means \"single instruction multiple data\", where each lane is allowed to communicate. For instance, the SSE instruction HADD is SIMD, not SIMT, because the lanes of the vector unit \"talk\". Likewise, gather is SIMT, whereas permute is SIMD. \n For many core (single die) devices, another problem is that the workload has to be fairly homogenous across all the ALU [vector] units, or you will starve the units when they thrash the local working set of hot data. This means that for SIMT architectures, it is not just enough to have homogeneous per ALU [vector] work, but also homogeneous workload across the entire device. \n This is entirely different from, say, the large scale server x86 boxes.

{"input_text": "Have you ever read Peter Singer? This is going to come as a bit of a shock to you because his perspectives can seem quite extreme particularly to someone who is used to putting human rights ahead of all other animal rights. \n Nevertheless, Peter Singer's approach is one of utilitarianism. The idea is that veganism is concerned with doing the least amount of harm possible. As another poster pointed out, there is no necessary opposition between the life of an animal and the life of a human, insofar as a human can eat vegetarian foods now'a'days and leave the animal alone completely. In this instance, you can minimize the harm done to an animal (by not killing it, subjecting it to cruelty, etc) without increasing the harm done to you in any material way (I mean, so what if you don't eat meat). \n Vegans therefore avoid animal products to minimize harm. Follow me so far? You could argue that if a chicken lives a plush and happy life, a vegan should be okay with eating eggs the chicken produces. In some cases, they ARE okay with this - I have known vegans who may selectively eat eggs if they know the farm and know the chickens were well cared for and not subjected to any harm. But this isn't about veganism, this is about abortion rights. \n So I can see how you could turn this back on me: how is terminating a pregnancy minimizing harm? Well this is a complicated question. For starters, consider the exemption sane pro-lifers give in instances of rape or incest. The idea here is that carrying the baby to term will be so cruel to the woman, so emotionally painful, that terminating the pregnancy is a logically acceptable answer. The woman may not be ready for parenthood, and the infant could have a difficult life because the mother lacks resources necessary to properly care for a child. Carrying the child to term could be just as cruel to the child as to the mother, as the child may not enjoy the loving support it needs to live a fulfilling life. Everyone suffers. \n Likewise, if the mother's life is at risk (such as ectopic pregnancy) - the woman could go on to bear HEALTHY children later in life that won't kill her. Forcing her to have a child that is guaranteed to terminate her life is not minimizing harm. \n The question is where to draw the line, then. Pro-choice advocates don't think that women should go out having abortions left and right. Nobody enjoys having abortions - it can be a difficult experience. But if a mother believes that having the child will be a net negative for herself and for the child - if the child is virtually guaranteed to have a difficult life because of the mother's current situation, or because it could harm the mother, because the mother did not intend to have a child and it would ruin her life to take care of the child - these might be valid reasons that having an abortion minimizes harm. \n Saying that abortion should be illegal under all circumstances (or only in an extremely limited subset) denies women the ability to minimize harm in some circumstances. The idea here is that state shouldn't be able to decide what is best for a woman's life, as the woman is the only one in a good position to make that call. \n Obviously, the preferred solution is to make access to birth control easy, to keep the public WELL EDUCATED (none of this \"abstinence is the only 100% effective method\" bullshit), and you will reduce abortions a HUGE amount. \n Anyway, if your ethical viewpoint is that all human life is absolutely to be protected under all circumstances, you may reach situations where your requirement of protecting human life makes people suffer greatly. Consider end-of-life care for terminal cancer patients. If the patient is in immense physical pain with no hope of recovery, would you require that they attempt to stay alive as long as possible, or would you be all right with them dying on their own terms? I'm not saying this is analogous to pregnancy, I'm just saying that there are some circumstances where an ethos that requires you to protect human life is NOT the same as protecting the QUALITY of human life. In some circumstances, a conflict might arise where the latter becomes just as important as the former, and the pro-choice argument is that the state shouldn't have a hand in deciding for someone individually.", "pseudo_summary_extractive": "Have you ever read Peter Singer ?

{"input_text": "this is going to take a long time to type....\nthis summer me and my best friend did some mushrooms, but these mushrooms were no ordinary mushrooms. \nIt's was a mid summer night, and we were bored as usual, so being the type of kids we are we started looking for acid, Which is never an easy find. After three hours nothing had turned up, and we had basically lost hope on the night. Thirty more minutes rolled around and we had long since called it quits, when my other friend said he could get boomers. \"hells yeah!\" I was thinking.... early assumption. My friend comes down to my house and we pile in my car to go get them, only about a twenty minute drive, and we would be getting them from a house so it wasn't at all sketchy.

I took the stem and my best friend had the caps. I forgot to mention that these shrooms were super weird looking (for magic mushrooms) and had this weird white powder on the outside. Anyway we scarf them down, and after about eight minutes I was FUCKED up. usually shrooms take about an hour to kick in so this made me a little nervous, but I figured oh well more time to trip. we decide to go on a walk and for the whole journey everything looked like it was in pixels, and the moon looked like the sun in minecraft. we walk back to my house and go down into my basement, throw on adult swim, and converse like we always do on mushrooms. this goes on for about two hours, and is a super good time until my best friend needed to take out his contacts. Now he is really blind, so I can no longer explain what he may be seeing, but I can tell you what I saw. After getting his contacts out, he gets really quiet. This makes me sort of uncomfortable, but I'm on shrooms, so i just rationalize it to the boomers. My belly started to feel upset so I turn to my friend and say, \"want to go smoke a bowl?\" to help me calm it down. He looks at me as if I were satan himself and yells, \"NO!!!\" So being somewhat annoyed at this i went to smoke a cigarette, Finish that up and go back downstairs. I had one of those Arizona dollar fruit punches and I took a drink of it. My friend says in a really sweet voice, \"hey man can I see that?\" I say , \"sure man\" and hand it to him. He takes the can, gives it that same look he gave me, and throws it at my fireplace.

He proceeds to eat the cigarette, getting the whole filter in his mouth before I can pull it out.

{"input_text": "You're 100% correct.  To add to this, I'd like to point out that policing cheating via third party software is pretty much the ONLY thing that Blizzard (or any other online game developer) should police.  The only exceptions I think would involve harassment (as in spam or real life threats) and other instances in which another player's actions are completely unavoidable to his/her victim. \n When developers step in to enforce \"fair play\" on players who are completely staying within the confines of the software that the developers themselves put out, you end up with a lot of discrepancies and unjust bans.  It's happened countless times, and I'm sure most of you have heard of similar situations where somebody found a quick way to get ahead of other players via legitimate, in-game means, and got banned for it.  It's happened on Xbox live, in Guild Wars, and EA is pretty notorious for this as well. If Blizzard adopted similar policies, we'd see people banned for clearing inferno with force armor abuse (release patch), stacking attack speed pre-nerf, using the currently \"OP\" trail of cinders rune, or farming with a WW barb.  These are all instances that many people have considered to be unfair advantage exploits, but it's detrimental to the game as a whole to ban players for such innovation. \n Some of you are probably saying \"well those exploits didn't directly effect other players.\" Sure, it's definitely not nice to scam people, but there could be so many things that people would consider to be a scam.  If they banned people for trade window scamming, who's to say they shouldn't ban people for things like equipping weak gold find gear in team games, or doing the max bid \"exploit\" that everyone was talking about a few weeks ago.  Both of these come at other players' expense, but none of them violate the terms of service. They are unforeseen, specific situations that inevitably arise in any online game and would be impossible to write them all into the EULA.  If they were to suddenly ban people for rules that were never outlined, it becomes yet another PR nightmare for them, as well as a (I think) very unethical policy. \n If Blizzard doesn't want people performing certain actions within the legitimate confines of their software, then they need to take it out on themselves, not the players.  By this I mean FIX IT ON THE SOFTWARE END so that players are unable to do this in the first place.  Granted, trade window scams are usually avoidable user error, but I also think they could be made safer to use, like they were for the most part in WoW. (Maybe they are by now, I haven't actually used one in awhile).  Blizzard is usually pretty good about fixing stuff like this, and I think their philosophy is similar to mine in that scams and exploits should be made impossible (if at all possible) before account bans should even be considered. \n Lastly, in the case of a possible \"macro\" like OP's situation, whether or not using a macro that allows you to switch an item out of the trade window quickly is an offense worth banning someone for is somewhat debatable.  While it is a third party program, it's impact on the game is minimal and avoidable (as seen in the OP's video).  It's also difficult to prove because some people might just be able to swap items quickly through practice.  OP's video did seem impossibly fast to me, but how would Blizzard be able to fairly gauge how fast is too fast for trade window swapping?  Besides, it still kind of goes along with what I've been saying about how player actions shouldn't be banned.  Macros are designed to simulate an action that a player can do anyway, just faster.  This type of situation can be completely avoided in the future if Blizzard fixes the trade window to lock up for several seconds after any type of item swap is detected. \n If OP is reading this far, I think your case would have been better accepted had you argued his offense was the use of a third party macro program, not the scam attempt itself.  Although I will admit that one Blizzard representative made it quite obvious that they either didn't read your email, or were only allowed to copy+paste a pre-written response.

{"input_text": "14 years experience here. It's not about what you do, it is how you do it. Many guilds base themselves on what they do instead of how they do it. \n Example: You want to do PvP. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of guilds out there that do PvP. That is -what- you do. \nNow -how- do you do it? Figure that out and keep it as your guild signature. If the -how- is that you train your members, teach them, have set trainers, accept complete newbies and show them the ropes using training sessions. Then that is how you do it, how you get the team together, how you keep the team ready for battle etc. \n Some people will like this and join up with you and stay with you because of that. Others will not like this and leave and join someone else. \n Those might join, for example, a guild where there is no training, no newbies are accepted and everyone plays at around the same level and the leader curses and yells at the members when they do something wrong, calling it tough love. Some members will leave because of this and join the first guild, others will like the bootcamp style ordering around stay in this guild.

{"input_text": "Well, lets see. I got tormented every morning in PE by some skank (who we'll call Jenny) who \"Just didn't like me\" She proceeded to try to make me her \"bitch\" (give her my things to \"borrow\", tell me to do things for her) and after I refused, proceeded to convince people that I was talking shit about them.

One thing leads to another and Kelly, who is HUGE, wants to fight me. Kelly threatens to stab me, gathers a hoard of people to jump me, and approaches me in a passing period. My friend who was with me, who also knew Kelly, tried to talk to her, and explain that she was being lied to, but Kelly's trailer trash cousin hit my buddy and they got into it before any actually discussion took place.

{"input_text": "On the face of it, yeah, 700 grams is a lot.  But I don't think it's necessarily as bad as you might think.  In fact, if you're offended by drug related crime, you should probably be in favor of casual users stock piling around that much... \n See, if you smoke on the regular, that much weed is still going to run out.  You're not going to use 700 grams all at once, so that volume has to be judged by consumption rate and accessibility of resupply.  That resin  might be his absolute primo stash that he dips into on rare occasion, and if he can only resupply every 3 years....  Basically, for some smokers (all day, erry day, amiright?), 700 grams can be 'just enough' and then they are totally satisfied in terms of drug transactions for a long while. \n Which brings me back to crime: since we can't keep even drugs out of super max prisons, let's work under the assumption that people are still going to be able to score on occasion.  Do we want lots of drug transactions with lots of hard to prosecute interactions, easy cash flow, and low costs of entry to the market combined with high investigatory costs?  Or do we want an industry that requires deep pockets to play around in (providing legal surface area and related assets), is continually dealing in significant volumes (minimizing the number of players), and with a minimum number of targets to legislate, investigate, and regulate all while having a more predictable supply to minimize market opportunity to new entrants? \n Smokers going out and scoring here and there keeps the drug war broad and wide, and punishes responsible users who get hit with disproportionate penalties for living their lives in a more law abiding manner.  And the only upside is more drug dealers who exist in an easier, more profitable, market.   Home or regional growers supplying large volumes of nationally grown weed to residential users for personal use (through the mail for example), would be indistinguishable from our current drug  use  situation, but would give us a fighting chance to eliminate the violent crime aspect of prohibition.

{"input_text": "I've found that low-class mobs, Centurions and Marauders most notably, seem to stagger consistently when they're in the radius of the Singularity. The chip damage and the stagger provides time enough for me to get shots off with the Hurricane. This tactic is sufficient enough for me to deal with general enemies. \n But I agree to a point. The Singularity-Adept really can't bank on priming and detonating their own explosions. They  can  self-detonate, but it requires the player to operate within a terrifying and narrow margin of error. As a duder who isn't very good at video games, that's probably not a square deal. \n I love the new Singularity Adept much in the same way I like the Paladin. I'm now a de facto shield stripper. 200+ damage p/second isn't monumental on Gold, but that chip damage plus the overwhelming assault from a Hurricane slotted with Disruptor Ammo helps the Adept soften the front lines up. Shockwave can stagger pretty much everything, and Warp is there to really hurt the armored guys. \n Maybe I'm in the minority on this, but I always found the Human Adept to be dependent on other strong power users.
