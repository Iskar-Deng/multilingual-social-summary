This includes superior, but they will not neccesarily be superior after imbuing (they get random base-modifications). Bloodfist and Gorefoot are both uniques (gold), and therefore not eligible for imbuing. When you imbue, the item level matters (the item level is hidden). The item is the same level as the monster who dropped it. That means, that the higher level the monster who dropped it, the more stats is available on that item. It is important to note that an item doesn't neccesarily use all it's stat potential. This means that the same item dropped in a1 and a2 can has the possibility of some very different outcomes. After the imbue, the item can be as good as if the monster itself had dropped a rare (yellow) item. Imbued weapons will always turn out as rare items. To answer your question, you should just progress like you are now, fighting the hardest monsters you can. Kapag lumitaw ang isang potensiyal na magandang puting bagay, sikaping ibue iyon. Class specifiq items has a better chance to give +skills to your class. Circlets has the higest bonuses regarding yellow items.

You can check out monster levels, and item qualities (normal, exceptional, elite) on arreat summit ofc. :) \n EDIT (forgot infoz):\nIn cases of imbue-eligible items with base bonuses (maces, wands, staffs and class specifique items, and any other item with +skills etc.) will loose their current bonuses due to the base item reroll. They can get extra skills from the base item AND the rarity class. Say, if you imbue a staff with +1 fireball, it will reroll that base staff. It might turn out with a staff with +1 icebolt and +1 warmth, and then you add the bonuses the rarity would give you, lets say +1 icebolt and +1 fireball. Then your +1 fireball staff will have turned into a +2 icebolt +1 fireball staff. It might as well turn into any other staff allowed by it's item lvl though.

If you're playing a sniper, get headshots, deal with counter sniping, and so on. Each class has their own foibles and learning curve. Ang makina marahil ang pinakamagaling na klase para sa 'rote' na mga aspekto nito, yamang ang karamihan ng kanilang maagang estratehiya sa laro ay pangunahin nang bumababa sa pagtatayo nang may ganap na bilis, gaya ng paggawa sa tanod at pamamahagi sa pamamagitan ng pangunahing pangingitlog upang takpan ang looban at kapuwa ang mga kalahok na ASAP sa buong pasimula.

You may not necessarily be great at a given class, but you migrate out of 'noob' territory in my book when it's clear your play mistakes are incidental rather than systemic.

Lesson 2: Play Your Team \n One thing I find really frustrating on many pub servers is that most people never really seem to get the idea of working together as a team. All classes have their strengths and weaknesses, and while you can go far on your own personal skill, the force multiplication of a coordinated effort is so huge that on pubs it is usually more important than skill unless it's entirely lopsided. Obvious things are like picking classes that cover where the team is weak. There's also more subtle stuff, like if you have an engineer building a forward base, help guard the zone for a few seconds if you don't have an immediate priority target to reach. Understanding the dynamics of timing and supporting the moves your allies make is a gigantic step out of noobdom. See an uber? Follow it. Know a spy's getting in position to sap?

{"input_text": "I have one very distinct memory of bad saves. In Final Fantasy Tactics, there's a boss encounter about 3/4ths of the way through the game that you have to fight with only your main character. It's at the end of a series of battles, meaning you can't move through the world map between them. The first time I ever played the game I got stuck here, I hadn't been staggering my saves, and saved over my only slot right after the first battle. I wasn't strong enough to defeat the boss and got stuck. I ended up having to restart from the beginning to beat him. Fast forward to Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions on the PSP. I was well aware of the boss, but I wasn't sure where. I had staggered saves and I was making sure that I always had a backup save. Somehow when it came time to fight that boss again, I had messed up my staggered saves and gotten stuck again. I think there was a cutscene or something before the first battle that you could save at, I don't quite remember exactly how I messed it up. I could go back to the battle before but that didn't help too much. Stuck yet again, I gave up. Luckily I aced it when I played through the game again on the iPhone. The best manual way to deal with it is to stagger saves over several slots, giving you X number of saves back from your current save. Ideally though you shouldn't have to think about it at all in a well-designed system. I wouldn't call your Dark Souls or FF issues related to bad saves. Those are both just part of the game that you have to deal with.

{"input_text": "Not sure if this change has been seriously discussed here but I think this is gonna be the biggest, most unbalancing change in PvP in 1.4. For the most part I liked the changes Bioware made to the other classes. Commandos & Sages got buffs where they needed it, DPS Scoundrels got some love (though still not enough imo), and I'm even fine with the Assault Vanguard nerfs to be honest. Dar spectrometrul Focus m-a derutat cel mai mult când am citit-o. I think if anything, most heavy PvPers (including Focus spec players) were expecting it to be hit with a nerf 1.4, instead it's the other way around. Everyone knows Focus Guardians (and to a lesser extent Sentinels) do the expected insane amounts of total damage (AOE spec, no big surprise) but what's crazy is that they'll often also have the biggest single hit in warzones, because of the way they can Force Stasis/Choke (skill tree node) and Leap in (Vindicator set bonus) to get extra damage + guaranteed crit (skill tree node). I'm fully augmented WH with optimized mods/enhancements and I'm lucky to hit 5.5k against BM and above opponents. У меня есть скриншоты Стражи, которые делают до 6,7k в тех же зонах войны, и также превосходят меня в полном ущербе. And Bioware is buffing them so they can Smash even  more  often? It wasn't until I talked to a friend who does PvE (which I almost never do) that he explained it's a PvE buff. Focus spec отстаёт супер сильно (около 15-20%, согласно DPS parsers) от Бдительности для Хранителей и других двух DPS деревьев для Sentinels в PvE. So they upping the frequency of Sweep to make up for this. Here's where I see 2 problems: \n 1) I doubt this is even gonna fix the PvE issue. A big part of Focus specs problem in PvE is the fact it's AOE and it'll wake up and hit all CC'd targets along with taking threat away from the tank that the tank might not have heavily taunted/attacked at that point. Aku punya perasaan yang paling berdedikasi PvErs masih akan tetap dengan spesifikasi lain karena lebih aman dan melakukan kerusakan baik-baik saja. 2) I understand in PvE, Focus spec is underwhelming against a boss with 500k - 1mill-k HP. The sustain just isn't there (pre 1.4). But in PvP burst is king and against players with 15k-20k health, hitting for 5k-6.5k damage every 15 seconds against everybody around them is VERY VERY GOOD. Şi acum va fi şi mai bine. I'm just gonna go out on a limb and say next few weeks Warzones are gonna be a bit rough when more and more ppl realize how strong Focus spec is post 1.4 and until it becomes an obvious enough issue that Bioware needs to balance patch this.", "summary_text": "As if Sweep/Smash spec wasn't already borderline OP in PvP, prepare to see a lot more of them come 1.4 buffs. \n EDIT: Don't want to give the impression that I thought Focus spec was totally and absolutely broken. It does have weaknesses like lack of sustain and nothing to really fall back on if Smash doesn't hit (at least till the next cooldown). Also it's one of those specs that is very gear dependent, meaning with bad gear, it is very very bad because of the weaknesses above. But it's also a spec that gets exponentially better once you have awesome gear because everything is focused down to a single bursty AOE attack that automatically crits and is kinetic damage so Knights can completely ignore accuracy and crit rating and stack main stat, power, and surge (which explains the 6.7k+ hits). So again, didn't think it was broken, but did think it was a bit too strong pre 1.4. And now it's getting buffed.

{"input_text": "I'm warning for a wall of text here. Actually there's quite a good explanation for this phenomenon. This is what we in marketing call branding. That is the creation of a brand. A brand in turn is \"A person, name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers.\" This is according to the american marketing association. Now in this case it has to do with personal branding. Rein, Kotler and Stoller (1987) define a celebrity as as ”A person whose name has attention-getting, interest-riveting, profit generating value”. By using a celebrity for endorsement in campaigns you can achieve something called co-branding. That means that the name of a celebrity is used to endorse a particular politician or party. This is the same as what Nike for example does with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods for example. They use their names, big names in their particular fields, to endorse endorse different kinds of products to give them more exposure. Katakan bahwa Anda ingin menjual sepatu. If you see two ads, one with just the shoe and one with Michael Jordan (or whatever celebrity you know of) you are by more or less always going to pay more attention to the one with the celebrity.

Because of the nature of politics, by that I mean that it's an area which very few people actually know that much about and the information can be ambiguous, they look to so called opinion leaders. These opinion leaders can be more or less anyone. For example Steven Colbert, Bill O'Riley,Engadget, Ray W Johnson or what ever ... someone people look to for some kind of information they are too lazy to find out themselves and which give them the information they think they need.

Jadi bukannya mencari hal-hal keluar sendiri Anda memilih seperti Madonna, karena Anda \"tahu\" Madonna dan Anda menyukainya, jadi dia mungkin benar.

{"input_text": "Ποιες αιτήσεις; Ты говоришь о SIMT или SIMD? I have considerable experience with coding  real  world applications (in customer's hands) for many-core (single die) architectures at this scale and [much] larger. I also write compilers for them. Could you give us an estimate of your current fetch/ALU ratio? Para sa mga hindi marunong tungkol sa mga aparatong ito, hayaan mong ilagay ko ito sa mga termino ng GPU (SIMT lamang; ang SIMD ay marami, mas mahirap na suriin): Ang pera ay katumbas ng isang sampol ng steak, ang ALU ay ang gawaing ginagawa sa sampol. If the arch's fetch/ALU ratio is 1:4, then you need 4 (pure, non loading) arithmetic operations per memory request to keep the part \"fed\". A ratio as low as 1:4 is only really possible with low clock rate/memory rate ratio, and (nearly pure) SIMT. For instance, a large RT pixel shader on a Radeon 5870 would have numbers like this. Ang SIMT ay nangangahulugang \"single instrucation multiple thread\" at tumutukoy sa mga ganap na non-communicating na proseso. SIMD means \"single instruction multiple data\", where each lane is allowed to communicate. De exemplu, instrucţiunea SSE HAD este SIMD, nu SIMT, deoarece benzile unităţii vectoriale \"vorbesc.\" Likewise, gather is SIMT, whereas permute is SIMD. For many core (single die) devices, another problem is that the workload has to be fairly homogenous across all the ALU [vector] units, or you will starve the units when they thrash the local working set of hot data. Это означает, что для архитектуры SIMT недостаточно иметь однородную работу на ALU [вектор], но также однородную рабочую нагрузку по всему устройству.

{"input_text": "Have you ever read Peter Singer? This is going to come as a bit of a shock to you because his perspectives can seem quite extreme particularly to someone who is used to putting human rights ahead of all other animal rights. Nevertheless, Peter Singer's approach is one of utilitarianism. Η ιδέα είναι ότι ο χορτοφαγισμός ενδιαφέρεται να κάνει το λιγότερο δυνατό κακό. As another poster pointed out, there is no necessary opposition between the life of an animal and the life of a human, insofar as a human can eat vegetarian foods now'a'days and leave the animal alone completely. In this instance, you can minimize the harm done to an animal (by not killing it, subjecting it to cruelty, etc) without increasing the harm done to you in any material way (I mean, so what if you don't eat meat). Vegans therefore avoid animal products to minimize harm. Follow me so far? You could argue that if a chicken lives a plush and happy life, a vegan should be okay with eating eggs the chicken produces. In some cases, they ARE okay with this - I have known vegans who may selectively eat eggs if they know the farm and know the chickens were well cared for and not subjected to any harm. But this isn't about veganism, this is about abortion rights. So I can see how you could turn this back on me: how is terminating a pregnancy minimizing harm? Well this is a complicated question. For starters, consider the exemption sane pro-lifers give in instances of rape or incest. The idea here is that carrying the baby to term will be so cruel to the woman, so emotionally painful, that terminating the pregnancy is a logically acceptable answer. The woman may not be ready for parenthood, and the infant could have a difficult life because the mother lacks resources necessary to properly care for a child. Faptul de a - l purta pe copil la termen ar putea fi la fel de crud pentru copil ca şi pentru mamă, deoarece copilul nu s - ar putea bucura de sprijinul iubitor de care are nevoie pentru a duce o viaţă împlinită. Everyone suffers. Likewise, if the mother's life is at risk (such as ectopic pregnancy) - the woman could go on to bear HEALTHY children later in life that won't kill her. Forcing her to have a child that is guaranteed to terminate her life is not minimizing harm. The question is where to draw the line, then. Pro-choice advocates don't think that women should go out having abortions left and right. Nobody enjoys having abortions - it can be a difficult experience. Dar dacă o mamă crede că a avea un copil va fi un negativ net pentru ea însăşi şi pentru copil - dacă copilul este practic garantat că va avea o viaţă dificilă din cauza situaţiei actuale a mamei, sau pentru că ar putea afecta mama, pentru că mama nu intenţiona să aibă un copil şi i-ar distruge viaţa pentru a avea grijă de copil - acestea ar putea fi motive întemeiate pentru care avortul minimizează răul. Saying that abortion should be illegal under all circumstances (or only in an extremely limited subset) denies women the ability to minimize harm in some circumstances. The idea here is that state shouldn't be able to decide what is best for a woman's life, as the woman is the only one in a good position to make that call. Obviously, the preferred solution is to make access to birth control easy, to keep the public WELL EDUCATED (none of this \"abstinence is the only 100% effective method\" bullshit), and you will reduce abortions a HUGE amount. Anyway, if your ethical viewpoint is that all human life is absolutely to be protected under all circumstances, you may reach situations where your requirement of protecting human life makes people suffer greatly. Consider end-of-life care for terminal cancer patients.

It's was a mid summer night, and we were bored as usual, so being the type of kids we are we started looking for acid, Which is never an easy find. After three hours nothing had turned up, and we had basically lost hope on the night. Thirty more minutes rolled around and we had long since called it quits, when my other friend said he could get boomers. \"hells yeah!\" Aku sedang berpikir .... asumsi awal. My friend comes down to my house and we pile in my car to go get them, only about a twenty minute drive, and we would be getting them from a house so it wasn't at all sketchy. We arrive, and my friend goes in to get them, my best friend and I chat in the car for about five minutes until the other friend comes back. S-a urcat în maşină şi a spus: \"Sunteţi aici pentru o noapte sălbatică, astea sunt din ascunzătoarea ei personală, şi nu sunt meniscuri psilocibin.\" To me and my best friend, this was awesome, something we had never tried, something new. Anyway we get back to my house and prepare to eat the boomers, we have a Quarter of an ounce to split, of which there was one massive stem and about eight caps. Я взял стебель и у моего лучшего друга были шапки. I forgot to mention that these shrooms were super weird looking (for magic mushrooms) and had this weird white powder on the outside. Oricum le-am eşarfa în jos, şi după aproximativ opt minute am fost futut. usually shrooms take about an hour to kick in so this made me a little nervous, but I figured oh well more time to trip. Nagpasiya kaming maglakad - lakad at sa buong paglalakbay ay ang lahat ng bagay ay para bang nasa mga pixel, at ang buwan ay parang araw sa minahan. we walk back to my house and go down into my basement, throw on adult swim, and converse like we always do on mushrooms. this goes on for about two hours, and is a super good time until my best friend needed to take out his contacts. Now he is really blind, so I can no longer explain what he may be seeing, but I can tell you what I saw. After getting his contacts out, he gets really quiet. This makes me sort of uncomfortable, but I'm on shrooms, so i just rationalize it to the boomers. My belly started to feel upset so I turn to my friend and say, \"want to go smoke a bowl?\" to help me calm it down. He looks at me as if I were satan himself and yells, \"NO!!!\" Jadi agak kesal saat ini saya pergi untuk merokok, menyelesaikan itu dan kembali ke bawah. I had one of those Arizona dollar fruit punches and I took a drink of it. Teman saya mengatakan dengan suara yang benar-benar manis, \"Hei manusia bisa saya lihat itu?\" I say , \"sure man\" and hand it to him. He takes the can, gives it that same look he gave me, and throws it at my fireplace. Mind you I am tripping harder then I had in a long time, to me time was unfathomable, everything was making intense patterns, so I could do nothing about this but yell, \"WHAT THE FUCK MAN?!\" he just looked at me an stood up, moving towards the stairs. This freaked me out because my parents were sleeping and I did not want to wake them up being on shrooms. So I grabbed my smokes and followed him. He walks up the stairs to the main level in my house and makes a break for the upstairs, at which point I grabbed him, because I did not want him up there. But he pulled away and got upstairs, and into my room. I follow him, but am intercepted by What I saw as a Dementor wearing a pink bathrobe, but was actually my mother. The hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life was give her a hug, because to me she was trying to suck my soul out. she walks downstairs, but to me she is floating, meanwhile my friend is derping around my room. But he sees me and instantly goes straight down the stairs and has a breakdown in front of the door, I push him outside and am walking out myself when my mother says, \"what's wrong?\" to which I respond a sharp, \"NOTHING.\" I close the door and my friend pulls out his pack, grabs a smoke from it, and throws both of them on the ground. Pagkatapos ay tumingin siya sa akin at nagtanong sa isang tonong snape-tulad ng, \"Maaari mo ba akong bigyan ng sigarilyo?\" Kaya sinunggaban ko ang isa na inihulog niya, inilagay ito sa kaniyang bibig at sinisindihan ito.

{"input_text": "You're 100% correct. To add to this, I'd like to point out that policing cheating via third party software is pretty much the ONLY thing that Blizzard (or any other online game developer) should police. The only exceptions I think would involve harassment (as in spam or real life threats) and other instances in which another player's actions are completely unavoidable to his/her victim. When developers step in to enforce \"fair play\" on players who are completely staying within the confines of the software that the developers themselves put out, you end up with a lot of discrepancies and unjust bans. It's happened countless times, and I'm sure most of you have heard of similar situations where somebody found a quick way to get ahead of other players via legitimate, in-game means, and got banned for it. It's happened on Xbox live, in Guild Wars, and EA is pretty notorious for this as well. If Blizzard adopted similar policies, we'd see people banned for clearing inferno with force armor abuse (release patch), stacking attack speed pre-nerf, using the currently \"OP\" trail of cinders rune, or farming with a WW barb. These are all instances that many people have considered to be unfair advantage exploits, but it's detrimental to the game as a whole to ban players for such innovation. Some of you are probably saying \"well those exploits didn't directly effect other players.\" Sure, it's definitely not nice to scam people, but there could be so many things that people would consider to be a scam. Αν απαγόρεψαν τους ανθρώπους για εξαπάτηση παραθύρου, που λέει ότι δεν πρέπει να απαγορεύουν ανθρώπους για πράγματα όπως ο εξοπλισμός αδύναμου χρυσού βρείτε εργαλεία σε ομαδικά παιχνίδια, ή κάνοντας τη μέγιστη προσφορά \"έκρηξη\" που όλοι μιλούσαν πριν από λίγες εβδομάδες. Both of these come at other players' expense, but none of them violate the terms of service. They are unforeseen, specific situations that inevitably arise in any online game and would be impossible to write them all into the EULA. If they were to suddenly ban people for rules that were never outlined, it becomes yet another PR nightmare for them, as well as a (I think) very unethical policy. If Blizzard doesn't want people performing certain actions within the legitimate confines of their software, then they need to take it out on themselves, not the players. By this I mean FIX IT ON THE SOFTWARE END so that players are unable to do this in the first place. Granted, trade window scams are usually avoidable user error, but I also think they could be made safer to use, like they were for the most part in WoW. (Ίσως είναι τώρα, έχω να χρησιμοποιήσω ένα εδώ και καιρό). Blizzard is usually pretty good about fixing stuff like this, and I think their philosophy is similar to mine in that scams and exploits should be made impossible (if at all possible) before account bans should even be considered. Sa huli, sa kaso ng isang posibleng \"macro\" na katulad ng sitwasyon ng OP, ang paggamit man o hindi ng makro na nagpapahintulot sa iyo na mabilis na alisin ang isang bagay sa bintanang pangkalakalan ay isang paglabag na sulit ipagbawal ng isa ay medyo madedebable. While it is a third party program, it's impact on the game is minimal and avoidable (as seen in the OP's video). Este, de asemenea, dificil de dovedit pentru că unii oameni ar putea fi doar în măsură să facă schimb de articole rapid prin practică. OP's video did seem impossibly fast to me, but how would Blizzard be able to fairly gauge how fast is too fast for trade window swapping? Besides, it still kind of goes along with what I've been saying about how player actions shouldn't be banned. Macros are designed to simulate an action that a player can do anyway, just faster. Acest tip de situație poate fi complet evitat în viitor dacă Blizzard fixează fereastra comercială pentru a bloca timp de câteva secunde după ce orice tip de swap element este detectat. If OP is reading this far, I think your case would have been better accepted had you argued his offense was the use of a third party macro program, not the scam attempt itself. Although I will admit that one Blizzard representative made it quite obvious that they either didn't read your email, or were only allowed to copy+paste a pre-written response.

Then that is how you do it, how you get the team together, how you keep the team ready for battle etc. Some people will like this and join up with you and stay with you because of that. Others will not like this and leave and join someone else. Those might join, for example, a guild where there is no training, no newbies are accepted and everyone plays at around the same level and the leader curses and yells at the members when they do something wrong, calling it tough love. Some members will leave because of this and join the first guild, others will like the bootcamp style ordering around stay in this guild. Both are pvp guilds. Another example for the pvp guild would be the seemingly random BYOB guild that focuses heavily on activity. Something is -always- happening. The BYOB nature of the guild means new techniques may be discovered but it also means it will lose a lot of matches because.. BYOB. (Bring Your Own Build) \n Another (probably better) explanation of what I mean with \"how\" is.. How do you handle internal conflicts? They -will- happen. My guild, The Order of the Black Lion investigates conflicts by taking everyone separate. We have a set procedure for that. Other guilds put all parties together and work it out by talking. We separate and work it out based on facts we get. We then do psychological mumbojumbo and fix stuff. Some guilds trust the older member over the newer member or trust higher ranked officers over lower ranked members. That works too. Not sure if it works well, but it works. I'm biased towards keeping everyone same level. Oh and regarding officers... This too is all about the -how- and the personality and signature of your guild. How do you pick officers? What are your officers for? Some guilds give officer positions to the first 10 members who join. I've never joined or had any dealing with those types of guilds so I don't know how effective that is (ahem). Other guilds have the officers be personal friends of the guild leader. It makes sense for the leader to make his friends officers because he knows them and can \"trust\" them. Tapi tidak semua orang yang adalah teman adalah petugas yang baik. In my guild, officer positions are temporary job-like positions given to people who do the thing we expect the officer to do anyway or are capable of doing it. Some guilds have their officers be long time members or members who are good at what they do etc. Another thing: the leader. What you do is PvP. How you manage stuff, how you do things is what defines what the guild is like. Change the leader to someone else and the guild changes fundamentally. The leader is the foundation. You set the identity, you set what the guild does. Members will come and go but the ones who identify with your guild are the ones who will stay, the ones who don't, will leave. And that is ok. \n Because of this, you are the guardian, the one who safeguards the guild, the one who leads its progression. Basically the one who leads. Obviously. If the guild changes into a direction your core member don't identify with or don't feel part of, you lose those members. You will get new ones but it won't be the same. What I mean is that when you set the identity, you also have to keep it, uphold it, etc. That's stability.", "summary_text": "Get an identity/philosophy and hold it", "translated_sentences": [37, 6], "translated_to": "Romanian"}

{"input_text": "On the face of it, yeah, 700 grams is a lot. Но я не думаю, что это обязательно так плохо, как ты думаешь. In fact, if you're offended by drug related crime, you should probably be in favor of casual users stock piling around that much... \n See, if you smoke on the regular, that much weed is still going to run out. Hindi ka gagamit ng 700 gramo nang sabay - sabay, kung kaya't ang dami ng nakukunsumo ay kailangang hatulan ayon sa dami ng nakukunsumo at madaling makuhang muli. That resin  might be his absolute primo stash that he dips into on rare occasion, and if he can only resupply every 3 years....  Basically, for some smokers (all day, erry day, amiright? ), 700 grams can be 'just enough' and then they are totally satisfied in terms of drug transactions for a long while. Which brings me back to crime: since we can't keep even drugs out of super max prisons, let's work under the assumption that people are still going to be able to score on occasion. Do we want lots of drug transactions with lots of hard to prosecute interactions, easy cash flow, and low costs of entry to the market combined with high investigatory costs? Or do we want an industry that requires deep pockets to play around in (providing legal surface area and related assets), is continually dealing in significant volumes (minimizing the number of players), and with a minimum number of targets to legislate, investigate, and regulate all while having a more predictable supply to minimize market opportunity to new entrants? Smokers going out and scoring here and there keeps the drug war broad and wide, and punishes responsible users who get hit with disproportionate penalties for living their lives in a more law abiding manner. And the only upside is more drug dealers who exist in an easier, more profitable, market. Home or regional growers supplying large volumes of nationally grown weed to residential users for personal use (through the mail for example), would be indistinguishable from our current drug  use  situation, but would give us a fighting chance to eliminate the violent crime aspect of prohibition. It also provides a reasonable framework for full taxation and national price competition (putting unsustainable cost pressure on illegal dealers), and can even be extended (through NAFTA), to deny  billions  of dollars every year to central and south american crime syndicates.", "summary_text": "middle aged white dudes who aren't sketching around in back alleys but blaze like a motherfucker when they come back from the office are gonna be prone to stockpile.
