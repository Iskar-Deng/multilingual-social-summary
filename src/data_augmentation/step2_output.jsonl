This includes superior, but they will not neccesarily be superior after imbuing (they get random base-modifications). Bloodfist and Gorefoot are both uniques (gold), and therefore not eligible for imbuing.\nWhen you imbue, the item level matters (the item level is hidden). The item is the same level as the monster who dropped it. That means, that the higher level the monster who dropped it, the more stats is available on that item. It is important to note that an item doesn't neccesarily use all it's stat potential. This means that the same item dropped in a1 and a2 can has the possibility of some very different outcomes.\nAfter the imbue, the item can be as good as if the monster itself had dropped a rare (yellow) item. Imbued weapons will always turn out as rare items.\nTo answer your question, you should just progress like you are now, fighting the hardest monsters you can. When a potential good white item appears, try to imbue that. Class specifiq items has a better chance to give +skills to your class. Circlets has the higest bonuses regarding yellow items.

You can check out monster levels, and item qualities (normal, exceptional, elite) on arreat summit ofc. :) \n EDIT (forgot infoz):\nIn cases of imbue-eligible items with base bonuses (maces, wands, staffs and class specifique items, and any other item with +skills etc.) will loose their current bonuses due to the base item reroll. They can get extra skills from the base item AND the rarity class. Say, if you imbue a staff with +1 fireball, it will reroll that base staff. It might turn out with a staff with +1 icebolt and +1 warmth, and then you add the bonuses the rarity would give you, lets say +1 icebolt and +1 fireball. Then your +1 fireball staff will have turned into a +2 icebolt +1 fireball staff. It might as well turn into any other staff allowed by it's item lvl though. \n As far as I recall, weapon damage and defense values are not rerolled. I am not 100% positive on this though.

{"input_text": "While I don't much support the term noob per se, I think the most useful definition of a player is their ability to understand and work in the team dynamic to push for victory. There are two main lessons a player must learn, and a bunch of secondary ones that stem from that. \n Lesson 1: Play Well Individually \n This is mostly the obvious part. If you're playing a sniper, get headshots, deal with counter sniping, and so on. Each class has their own foibles and learning curve. Engineer is probably the best class for the 'rote' aspects of this, as much of their early game strategy basically comes down to building perfectly at an optimal speed, like getting the sentry and dispenser up by the main spawn to cover the courtyard and both forward entries ASAP on round start. Other classes are more implicit, like knowing how to use the maps for scouts, spies, and soldiers. Knowing how to set an effective sticky trap. \n You may not necessarily be great at a given class, but you migrate out of 'noob' territory in my book when it's clear your play mistakes are incidental rather than systemic. Got killed by a random enemy poking around a corner? Not a noob error. Missed a clutch shot and died in an important firefight? Happens to the best of us. Over-extend into a front line? Probably a noob mistake. \n Lesson 2: Play Your Team \n One thing I find really frustrating on many pub servers is that most people never really seem to get the idea of working together as a team. All classes have their strengths and weaknesses, and while you can go far on your own personal skill, the force multiplication of a coordinated effort is so huge that on pubs it is usually more important than skill unless it's entirely lopsided. \n Obvious things are like picking classes that cover where the team is weak. There's also more subtle stuff, like if you have an engineer building a forward base, help guard the zone for a few seconds if you don't have an immediate priority target to reach. Understanding the dynamics of timing and supporting the moves your allies make is a gigantic step out of noobdom. See an uber? Follow it. Know a spy's getting in position to sap? Try to pull attention. \n At a higher level of play, you can begin to perform some actions that would normally be somewhat noobish with deeper thought and skill in mind to achieve a bigger goal. For example, you're a scout and can afford to break ahead of your team's push of the fourth point, and the fifth is clear. But the other team is moving as a squad back to the other point. Do you cap or harass? This is a complex question, but there are times when the right answer is to run through their team to try and force a medic kill or at least slow their push enough to get the cap and give the rest of your team spare moments to reload for the fight.", "pseudo_summary_paraphrased": "While I n't much support the term noob se, I think the meaningful definition of ability is .

{"input_text": "I have one very distinct memory of bad saves. In Final Fantasy Tactics, there's a boss encounter about 3/4ths of the way through the game that you have to fight with only your main character. It's at the end of a series of battles, meaning you can't move through the world map between them. The first time I ever played the game I got stuck here, I hadn't been staggering my saves, and saved over my only slot right after the first battle. I wasn't strong enough to defeat the boss and got stuck. I ended up having to restart from the beginning to beat him. \n Fast forward to Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions on the PSP. I was well aware of the boss, but I wasn't sure where. I had staggered saves and I was making sure that I always had a backup save. Somehow when it came time to fight that boss again, I had messed up my staggered saves and gotten stuck again. I think there was a cutscene or something before the first battle that you could save at, I don't quite remember exactly how I messed it up. I could go back to the battle before but that didn't help too much. Stuck yet again, I gave up. Luckily I aced it when I played through the game again on the iPhone. \n The best manual way to deal with it is to stagger saves over several slots, giving you X number of saves back from your current save. Ideally though you shouldn't have to think about it at all in a well-designed system. \n I wouldn't call your Dark Souls or FF issues related to bad saves.

{"input_text": "Not sure if this change has been seriously discussed here but I think this is gonna be the biggest, most unbalancing change in PvP in 1.4. For the most part I liked the changes Bioware made to the other classes. Commandos & Sages got buffs where they needed it, DPS Scoundrels got some love (though still not enough imo), and I'm even fine with the Assault Vanguard nerfs to be honest. But the buff to Focus spec baffled me for the longest time when I read it. I think if anything, most heavy PvPers (including Focus spec players) were expecting it to be hit with a nerf 1.4, instead it's the other way around. \n Everyone knows Focus Guardians (and to a lesser extent Sentinels) do the expected insane amounts of total damage (AOE spec, no big surprise) but what's crazy is that they'll often also have the biggest single hit in warzones, because of the way they can Force Stasis/Choke (skill tree node) and Leap in (Vindicator set bonus) to get extra damage + guaranteed crit (skill tree node). I'm fully augmented WH with optimized mods/enhancements and I'm lucky to hit 5.5k against BM and above opponents. I've screenshots of Guardians doing up to 6.7k in those same warzones while also surpassing me in total damage. And Bioware is buffing them so they can Smash even  more  often? \n It wasn't until I talked to a friend who does PvE (which I almost never do) that he explained it's a PvE buff. Focus spec lags super hard (around 15-20% according to DPS parsers) behind Vigilance for Guardians and the other 2 DPS trees for Sentinels in PvE. So they upping the frequency of Sweep to make up for this. \n Here's where I see 2 problems: \n 1) I doubt this is even gonna fix the PvE issue. A big part of Focus specs problem in PvE is the fact it's AOE and it'll wake up and hit all CC'd targets along with taking threat away from the tank that the tank might not have heavily taunted/attacked at that point. I have a feeling most dedicated PvErs are still gonna stick with the other specs because it's safer and does damage just fine. \n 2) I understand in PvE, Focus spec is underwhelming against a boss with 500k - 1mill-k HP. The sustain just isn't there (pre 1.4). But in PvP burst is king and against players with 15k-20k health, hitting for 5k-6.5k damage every 15 seconds against everybody around them is VERY VERY GOOD. And now it's gonna get even better. \n I'm just gonna go out on a limb and say next few weeks Warzones are gonna be a bit rough when more and more ppl realize how strong Focus spec is post 1.4 and until it becomes an obvious enough issue that Bioware needs to balance patch this.", "pseudo_summary_paraphrased": "Not sure discussed, but I think Gon.

I'm not opposed to a bump of coke or two a couple times a year when it's around, I'll eat some mushrooms on a camping trip in the woods every couple years or so for a good cerebral dump and wipe, I smoke marijuana fairly regularly it's a good way to unwind with a beer at the end of the day, I drink beer and have begun brewing my own because it's a fun hobby, and I enjoy smoking cigars with my dad or my uncles when we have time to visit.  My girlfriend and I live together and I've never pushed anything on her.  She is aware of how I take my pleasure by the dose sometimes.

On the other hand she is asking the same of you from a different perspective, that you abstain like her.  It's obvious you have no interest to change either. \n There's your answer, staring you right in the face.  If you have experienced such incompatibility on such regular intervals over the same issue which neither of you have an interest in changing, then stop beating yourself up.  Give up on this rollercoaster because it is emotionally draining and hurtful for both of you.  You are young, probably intelligent, and have a lot of time ahead of you.  Learn from this and be yourself.  You are yourself, she is herself, and if either has to change to fit the other's expectations, when these expectations are unreal, then be yourself by yourself and not what she wants you to be.  I don't think you're going to be able to compromise with your current attitude about drugs.  You need to find somebody less hung up on your drug use, and you also need to reexamine why you need her so badly to \"try before you say no\" to validate your own use.  You yourself validate your own actions, no one else.  Own that and get yourself out of this relationship before you damage yourselves even further. \n There are millions of other girls out there who could make a better match for you.

{"input_text": "I'm warning for a wall of text here. \n Actually there's quite a good explanation for this phenomenon. This is what we in marketing call branding. That is the creation of a brand. A brand in turn is \"A person, name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers.\" This is according to the american marketing association. Now in this case it has to do with personal branding. \n Rein, Kotler and Stoller (1987) define a celebrity as as ”A person whose name has attention-getting, interest-riveting, profit generating value”. By using a celebrity for endorsement in campaigns you can achieve something called co-branding. That means that the name of a celebrity is used to endorse a particular politician or party. This is the same as what Nike for example does with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods for example. They use their names, big names in their particular fields, to endorse endorse different kinds of products to give them more exposure. \n Say that you want to sell a shoe. If you see two ads, one with just the shoe and one with Michael Jordan (or whatever celebrity you know of) you are by more or less always going to pay more attention to the one with the celebrity. \n Alright so now we've covered the basics. Now we are coming to word of mouth or as we are here online we are talking about word of mouse. Because of the nature of politics, by that I mean that it's an area which very few people actually know that much about and the information can be ambiguous, they look to so called opinion leaders. These opinion leaders can be more or less anyone. For example Steven Colbert, Bill O'Riley,Engadget, Ray W Johnson or what ever ... someone people look to for some kind of information they are too lazy to find out themselves and which give them the information they think they need. \n Now say that you know jack shit about politics and you are ha huge fan of Madonna, then you'll most probably think that Madonna probably is on to something. So instead of finding stuff out yourself you vote like Madonna, because you \"know\" Madonna and you like her, so she's probably right. That means that Madonna is your opinion leader in this case. Same goes for basically all other brands, both for intangible and tangible \"products\". \n I could probably continue writing about this stuff all day but I think you get the picture from this.", "pseudo_summary_paraphrased": "I'm warning for here.

{"input_text": "You love yourself more than her.  That's not inherently wrong, at your age this is natural.  You should probably leave her though because you will hurt her in the end.  I won't advocate changing yourself to her expectations because I think her expectations do not take you into account either.  I think both of you would be better off with more compatible people. \n I use drugs a lot like you do.  I'm not opposed to a bump of coke or two a couple times a year when it's around, I'll eat some mushrooms on a camping trip in the woods every couple years or so for a good cerebral dump and wipe, I smoke marijuana fairly regularly it's a good way to unwind with a beer at the end of the day, I drink beer and have begun brewing my own because it's a fun hobby, and I enjoy smoking cigars with my dad or my uncles when we have time to visit.  My girlfriend and I live together and I've never pushed anything on her.  She is aware of how I take my pleasure by the dose sometimes.  She enjoys beer, and has taken an interest in brewing so we have a shared hobby, and the occasional toke, but has no interest in other drugs.  I don't need her to take drugs to validate myself, and she doesn't require me to abstain to appease her own self-interest.  We are compatible and sensible with each other.  This is how we are and I wouldn't change her, and she doesn't need to change me. \n However I have a problem with your story.  Why do you feel the need to validate yourself by pressuring her to use these substances the way you do?  It's obvious she has no interest.  On the other hand she is asking the same of you from a different perspective, that you abstain like her.  It's obvious you have no interest to change either. \n There's your answer, staring you right in the face.  If you have experienced such incompatibility on such regular intervals over the same issue which neither of you have an interest in changing, then stop beating yourself up.  Give up on this rollercoaster because it is emotionally draining and hurtful for both of you.  You are young, probably intelligent, and have a lot of time ahead of you.  Learn from this and be yourself.  You are yourself, she is herself, and if either has to change to fit the other's expectations, when these expectations are unreal, then be yourself by yourself and not what she wants you to be.  I don't think you're going to be able to compromise with your current attitude about drugs.  You need to find somebody less hung up on your drug use, and you also need to reexamine why you need her so badly to \"try before you say no\" to validate your own use.  You yourself validate your own actions, no one else.  Own that and get yourself out of this relationship before you damage yourselves even further. \n There are millions of other girls out there who could make a better match for you.  Probably an older you, because I think I've been you and I think you still have some growing up to do before you commit to long term relationships especially ones as emotionally draining as this one.  You're only 23 and you've been with her since 18?  I've seen this happen in my own friends' relationships and it's usually an impediment to adulthood.  Think about it, you've been together since you were children.  You've become emotionally dependent on each other even though you're both growing up into very different adults.  Time to move on and into your own adulthood and stop holding each other back.  It can be an amicable break, time shared in love is very meaningful and will stay with you both forever, but every good thing must come to an end and you've postponed that point for too long now.", "pseudo_summary_paraphrased": "I'm not against, I'm going to eat some mushrooms for two years, so for dump, I smoke marijuana fairly regularly it's a good way to relax, I drink beer and have started brewing my own, because it's a fun hobby, and I enjoy smoking cigars with father when we have time visit.

{"input_text": "I'm warning for a wall of text here. \n Actually there's quite a good explanation for this phenomenon. This is what we in marketing call branding. That is the creation of a brand. A brand in turn is \"A person, name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers.\" This is according to the american marketing association. Now in this case it has to do with personal branding. \n Rein, Kotler and Stoller (1987) define a celebrity as as ”A person whose name has attention-getting, interest-riveting, profit generating value”. By using a celebrity for endorsement in campaigns you can achieve something called co-branding. That means that the name of a celebrity is used to endorse a particular politician or party. This is the same as what Nike for example does with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods for example. They use their names, big names in their particular fields, to endorse endorse different kinds of products to give them more exposure. \n Say that you want to sell a shoe. If you see two ads, one with just the shoe and one with Michael Jordan (or whatever celebrity you know of) you are by more or less always going to pay more attention to the one with the celebrity. \n Alright so now we've covered the basics. Now we are coming to word of mouth or as we are here online we are talking about word of mouse. Because of the nature of politics, by that I mean that it's an area which very few people actually know that much about and the information can be ambiguous, they look to so called opinion leaders. These opinion leaders can be more or less anyone. For example Steven Colbert, Bill O'Riley,Engadget, Ray W Johnson or what ever ... someone people look to for some kind of information they are too lazy to find out themselves and which give them the information they think they need. \n Now say that you know jack shit about politics and you are ha huge fan of Madonna, then you'll most probably think that Madonna probably is on to something. So instead of finding stuff out yourself you vote like Madonna, because you \"know\" Madonna and you like her, so she's probably right. That means that Madonna is your opinion leader in this case. Same goes for basically all other brands, both for intangible and tangible \"products\". \n I could probably continue writing about this stuff all day but I think you get the picture from this.", "pseudo_summary_paraphrased": "I'm warning for here.

This night my luck would change! \n We get to her apartment and it smells like testicles after basketball practice. No big deal, at least she had a tidy place. We lay on the couch after putting any movie into the DVD player. Started kissing, and other stuff adults are notorious for. \n As I am getting some neck, her iguana climbs slowly on to my back. (She lets it roam free; this explains the odor.) \"Oh look! It's Q-Ball!\" She says cheerfully. She grabs him off of my back and his claws scratch me all to hell. \"Uhh. Hello there, Q-Ball...\" I said concealing my irritation. We stop making out and she delivers a lengthy introduction to the huge lizard. I'm pretty sure Q-Ball knows my name, favorite color, and birthday at this point. \n \"Wanna feed him!?\" she asked enthusiastically. \"Yeah, that'd be cool!\" I replied as genuinely as I could. No one appreciates being cock-blocked by a reptile. It's not like I felt inadequate, I know damn well I can please a woman better than some scaly tree crawler. We fed Q-Ball chunks of squash and that's when she dropped the bomb on me. \n \"He really likes you. But we can't do anything tonight. Q-Ball has been with me a long time and he's got my six. We should wait and get to know each other better first. I'm sure you understand.\" she said. I just shrugged and pecked her on the cheek. \"Of course I understand. I'm glad you have a friend in Q-Ball.\" I said rather convincingly. \n We've been dating for a few months now and just last night I finally got to seal the deal with her. She was amazing in bed! But she insisted Q-Ball had to watch us because she couldn't get aroused unless she knew she was safe. If that girl ever cheats on me, it will be with Q-Ball, I just know it.

{"input_text": "14 years experience here. It's not about what you do, it is how you do it. Many guilds base themselves on what they do instead of how they do it. \n Example: You want to do PvP. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of guilds out there that do PvP. That is -what- you do. \nNow -how- do you do it? Figure that out and keep it as your guild signature. If the -how- is that you train your members, teach them, have set trainers, accept complete newbies and show them the ropes using training sessions. Then that is how you do it, how you get the team together, how you keep the team ready for battle etc. \n Some people will like this and join up with you and stay with you because of that. Others will not like this and leave and join someone else. \n Those might join, for example, a guild where there is no training, no newbies are accepted and everyone plays at around the same level and the leader curses and yells at the members when they do something wrong, calling it tough love. Some members will leave because of this and join the first guild, others will like the bootcamp style ordering around stay in this guild. Both are pvp guilds. \n Another example for the pvp guild would be the seemingly random BYOB guild that focuses heavily on activity. Something is -always- happening. The BYOB nature of the guild means new techniques may be discovered but it also means it will lose a lot of matches because.. BYOB. (Bring Your Own Build) \n Another (probably better) explanation of what I mean with \"how\" is.. How do you handle internal conflicts? They -will- happen. \nMy guild, The Order of the Black Lion investigates conflicts by taking everyone separate. We have a set procedure for that. Other guilds put all parties together and work it out by talking. We separate and work it out based on facts we get. We then do psychological mumbojumbo and fix stuff. \nSome guilds trust the older member over the newer member or trust higher ranked officers over lower ranked members. That works too. Not sure if it works well, but it works. I'm biased towards keeping everyone same level. Oh and regarding officers... \n This too is all about the -how- and the personality and signature of your guild. How do you pick officers? What are your officers for? Some guilds give officer positions to the first 10 members who join. I've never joined or had any dealing with those types of guilds so I don't know how effective that is (ahem). Other guilds have the officers be personal friends of the guild leader. It makes sense for the leader to make his friends officers because he knows them and can \"trust\" them. But not everyone who is a friend is a good officer. \nIn my guild, officer positions are temporary job-like positions given to people who do the thing we expect the officer to do anyway or are capable of doing it. \nSome guilds have their officers be long time members or members who are good at what they do etc. \n Another thing: the leader. What you do is PvP. How you manage stuff, how you do things is what defines what the guild is like. Change the leader to someone else and the guild changes fundamentally. The leader is the foundation. You set the identity, you set what the guild does. \n Members will come and go but the ones who identify with your guild are the ones who will stay, the ones who don't, will leave. And that is ok. \n Because of this, you are the guardian, the one who safeguards the guild, the one who leads its progression. Basically the one who leads. Obviously. \nIf the guild changes into a direction your core member don't identify with or don't feel part of, you lose those members. You will get new ones but it won't be the same. What I mean is that when you set the identity, you also have to keep it, uphold it, etc. That's stability.", "pseudo_summary_paraphrased": "The years of experience is here. We're members, it's to do.

Others will not like this and go otherwise. These can join because, a guild is, no newcomers are accepted and everyone plays and the curses wrong, call.

In fact, if you're offended by drug related crime, you should probably be in favor of casual users stock piling around that much... \n See, if you smoke on the regular, that much weed is still going to run out.

Do we want lots of drug transactions with lots of hard to prosecute interactions, easy cash flow, and low costs of entry to the market combined with high investigatory costs?

And the only upside is more drug dealers who exist in an easier, more profitable, market.   Home or regional growers supplying large volumes of nationally grown weed to residential users for personal use (through the mail for example), would be indistinguishable from our current drug  use  situation, but would give us a fighting chance to eliminate the violent crime aspect of prohibition.
