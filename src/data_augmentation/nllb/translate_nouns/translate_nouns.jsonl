This includes superior , but they will not neccesarily be superior after imbuing ( they get random base-modifications ) . Bloodfist and Gorefoot are both uniques ( gold ) , and therefore not eligible for imbuing . When you imbue , the item level matters ( the item antas is hidden ) . The item is the same level as the monster who dropped it . That means , that the higher level the monster who dropped it , the more stats is available on that item . It is important to note that an item does n't neccesarily use all it 's stat potential . This means that the same item dropped in a1 and a2 can has the possibility of some very different outcomes . After the imbue , the item can be as good as if the monster itself had dropped a rare ( yellow ) item . Imbued weapons will always turn out as rare items . To answer your question , you should just progress like you are now , fighting the hardest monsters you can . When a potential good white item appears , try to imbue that . Class specifiq items has a better chance to give +skills to your class . Circlets has the higest bonuses regarding yellow items .

It might turn out with a staff with +1 icebolt and +1 warmth , and then you add the bonuses the rarity would give you , lets say +1 icebolt and +1 fireball . Then your +1 fireball staff will have turned into a +2 icebolt +1 fireball staff . It might as well turn into any other staff allowed by it 's item lvl though .

{"input_text": "While I do n't much support the termeni noob per se , I think the most useful definition of a jucător is their ability to understand and work in the team dinamică to push for victory . There are two main lessons a player must learn , and a bunch of secondary ones that stem from that . Lesson 1 : Play Well Individually This is mostly the obvious part . If you 're playing a sniper , get headshots , deal with counter sniping , and so on . Each clasă has their own foibles and learning curbă . Engineer is probably the best clasă for the 'rote ' aspects of this , as much of their early game strategy basically comes down to building perfectly at an optimal speed , like getting the sentry and dispenser up by the main spawn to cover the courtyard and both forward entries ASAP on round start . Other classes are more implicit , like knowing how to use the maps for scouts , spies , and soldiers . Knowing how to set an effective sticky trap . You may not necessarily be great at a given class , but you migrate out of 'noob ' territory in my carte when it 's clear your play mistakes are incidental rather than systemic . Got killed by a random enemy poking around a colţ ? Not a noob error . Missed a clutch shot and died in an important firefight ? Happens to the best of us . Over-extend into a front line ? Probably a noob mistake . Lesson 2 : Play Your Team One thing I find really frustrating on many pub servers is that most people never really seem to get the idea of working together as a team . All classes have their strengths and weaknesses , and while you can go far on your own personal abilități , the force multiplication of a coordinated effort is so huge that on pubs it is usually more important than skill unless it 's entirely lopsided . Obvious things are like picking classes that cover where the team is weak . There 's also more subtle lucruri , like if you have an engineer building a forward base , help guard the zone for a few seconds if you do n't have an immediate priority target to reach . Understanding the dynamics of timing and supporting the moves your allies make is a gigantic step out of noobdom . See an uber ? Follow it . Know a spion 's getting in poziţie to sap ? Try to pull Atenţie . At a higher nivel of play , you can begin to perform some actions that would normally be somewhat noobish with deeper thought and skill in mintea to achieve a bigger goal . For exemplu , you 're a scout and can afford to break ahead of your team 's împinge of the fourth point , and the fifth is clear . But the other echipă is moving as a squad back to the other point . Do you cap or harass ?

{"input_text": "I have one very distinct memory of bad saves . In Final Fantasy Tactics , there 's a boss encounter about 3/4ths of the Ο τρόπος through the game that you have to fight with only your main character . It 's at the end of a series of battles , meaning you ca n't move through the world map between them . The first time I ever played the game I got stuck here , I had n't been staggering my saves , and saved over my only slot right after the first battle . I was n't strong enough to defeat the boss and got stuck . I ended up having to restart from the beginning to beat him . Fast προς τα εμπρός to Final Fantasy Tactics : War of the Lions on the PSP .

{"input_text": "Not sure if this change has been seriously discussed here but I think this is gon na be the biggest , most unbalancing change in PvP in 1.4 . For the most part I liked the changes Bioware made to the other classes . Commandos & Sages got buffs where they needed it , DPS Scoundrels got some любовь ( though still not enough imo ) , and I 'm even fine with the Assault Vanguard nerfs to be honest . But the Бюф to Focus спецификация baffled me for the longest time when I read it . I think if anything , most heavy PvPers ( including Focus spec players ) were expecting it to be hit with a nerf 1.4 , instead it 's the other way around . Everyone knows Focus Guardians ( and to a lesser extent Sentinels ) do the expected insane amounts of total повреждения ( AOE спецификация , no big неожиданность ) but what 's безумный is that they 'll often also have the biggest single ударился in warzones , because of the путь they can Force Stasis/Choke ( skill tree node ) and Leap in ( Vindicator set бонус ) to get extra повреждения + guaranteed Критический ( skill tree node ) . I 'm fully augmented WH with optimized mods/enhancements and I 'm lucky to hit 5.5k against BM and above opponents . I 've screenshots of Guardians doing up to 6.7k in those same warzones while also surpassing me in total damage . And Bioware is buffing them so they can Smash even more often ? It was n't until I talked to a friend who does PvE ( which I almost never do ) that he explained it 's a PvE Бюф . Focus spec lags super тяжело ( around 15-20 % according to DPS parsers ) behind Vigilance for Guardians and the other 2 DPS trees for Sentinels in PvE . So they upping the частота of Sweep to make up for this . Here 's where I see 2 problems : 1 ) I doubt this is even gon na fix the PvE issue . A big part of Focus спецификации проблема in PvE is the Факты it 's AOE and it 'll wake up and hit all CC 'd targets along with taking угроза away from the резервуар that the резервуар might not have heavily taunted/attacked at that point . I have a feeling most dedicated PvErs are still gon na stick with the other спецификации because it 's safer and does damage just fine . 2 ) I understand in PvE , Focus spec is underwhelming against a босс with 500k - 1mill-k HP . The поддерживать just is n't there ( pre 1.4 ) . But in PvP взрыв is king and against players with 15k-20k health , hitting for 5k-6.5k damage every 15 seconds against Всех. around them is VERY VERY GOOD . And now it 's gon na get even better . I 'm just gon na go out on a limb and say next few weeks Warzones are gon na be a bit rough when more and more ppl realize how strong Focus spec is post 1.4 and until it becomes an obvious enough Вопрос that Bioware needs to balance patch this .", "summary_text": "As if Sweep/Smash spec wasn't already borderline OP in PvP, prepare to see a lot more of them come 1.4 buffs. \n EDIT: Don't want to give the impression that I thought Focus spec was totally and absolutely broken. It does have weaknesses like lack of sustain and nothing to really fall back on if Smash doesn't hit (at least till the next cooldown). Also it's one of those specs that is very gear dependent, meaning with bad gear, it is very very bad because of the weaknesses above. But it's also a spec that gets exponentially better once you have awesome gear because everything is focused down to a single bursty AOE attack that automatically crits and is kinetic damage so Knights can completely ignore accuracy and crit rating and stack main stat, power, and surge (which explains the 6.7k+ hits). So again, didn't think it was broken, but did think it was a bit too strong pre 1.4. And now it's getting buffed.

That is the creation of a Εμβληματική . A Εμβληματική in Γύρισμα is `` A person , όνομα , όρος , σχεδιασμός , symbol , or any other feature that identifies one seller 's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers . '' This is according to the american marketing association . Now in this case it has to do with personal branding . Rein , Kotler and Stoller ( 1987 ) define a διάσημος as as ” A person whose όνομα has - να τραβήξει την προσοχή , interest-riveting , κέρδος generating Αξία ” . By using a celebrity for endorsement in campaigns you can achieve Κάτι . called co-branding . That means that the όνομα of a celebrity is used to endorse a particular πολιτικός or Πάρτι . This is the same as what Nike for example does with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods for example . They use their names , big names in their particular fields , to endorse endorse different kinds of products to give them more exposure . Say that you want to sell a παπούτσια . If you see two ads , one with just the παπούτσια and one with Michael Jordan ( or whatever celebrity you know of ) you are by more or less always going to pay more attention to the one with the celebrity . Alright so now we 've covered the basics . Now we are coming to word of mouth or as we are here online we are talking about λέξη of mouse . Because of the φύση of politics , by that I mean that it 's an περιοχή which very few people actually know that much about and the information can be ambiguous , they look to so called opinion leaders . These opinion leaders can be more or less anyone . For παράδειγμα Steven Colbert , Bill O'Riley , Engadget , Ray W Johnson or what ever ... someone people look to for some kind of Πληροφορίες they are too lazy to find out themselves and which give them the Πληροφορίες they think they need . Now say that you know jack shit about politics and you are ha huge ανεμιστήρα of Madonna , then you 'll most probably think that Madonna probably is on to Κάτι . . So instead of finding stuff out yourself you vote like Madonna , because you `` know '' Madonna and you like her , so she 's probably right . That means that Madonna is your opinion ηγέτης in this case . Το ίδιο . goes for basically all other brands , both for intangible and tangible `` products '' .

The night goes well and she is all over my рукой . I am still quiet and sometimes I have to deftly tuck my dong under my belt to avoid being mistaken as some jerk . We decide her place is where we 'll go and off we went . This night my luck would change ! We get to her apartment and it smells like testicles after basketball practice . No big deal , at least she had a tidy place . We lay on the couch after putting any movie into the DVD player . Started kissing , and other stuff adults are notorious for . As I am getting some neck , her iguana climbs slowly on to my back . ( She lets it roam free ; this explains the odor . ) `` Oh look ! It 's Q-Ball ! '' She says cheerfully .

We should wait and get to know each other better first . I 'm sure you understand . '' she said . I just shrugged and pecked her on the cheek . `` Of course I understand .

{"input_text": "What applications ? Are you talking SIMT or SIMD ? I have considerable experience with coding real world applications ( in customer 's hands ) for many-core ( single die ) architectures at this scale and [ much ] larger . I also write compilers for them . Could you give us an estimate of your current fetch/ALU ratio ? For those who do n't know about these devices , let me put it into GPU terms ( SIMT only ; SIMD is much , much harder to analyze ) : fetch would correspond to a texture sample , ALU is the work done on the sample . If the arch 's fetch/ALU ratio is 1:4 , then you need 4 ( pure , non loading ) arithmetic operations per memory request to keep the part `` fed '' . A ratio as low as 1:4 is only really possible with low oras rate/memory rate ratio , and ( nearly pure ) SIMT . For instance , a large RT pixel shader on a Radeon 5870 would have numbers like this . SIMT means `` single instruction multiple thread '' and refers to totally non-communicating processes . SIMD means `` single pagtuturo multiple data '' , where each lane is allowed to communicate . For instance , the SSE instruction HADD is SIMD , not SIMT , because the lanes of the ang vector unit `` talk '' . Likewise , gather is SIMT , whereas permute is SIMD . For many core ( single die ) devices , another problem is that the workload has to be fairly homogenous across all the ALU [ vector ] units , or you will starve the units when they thrash the local working set of hot data . This means that for SIMT architectures , it is not just enough to have homogeneous per ALU [ vector ] work , but also homogeneous karga ng trabaho across the entire device . This is entirely different from , say , the large scale server x86 boxes . These devices are truly high-throughput serial devices , designed to allow an enormous halaga of ang mga bagay na on the local working set . They do this with high kadalas rates , OOO pipes , and staged caches of every ( ginormous ) sizes , and narrow vector units .", "summary_text": "This is possible on GPGPU-like (homogeneous) workloads with a low clock rate.

Well it was the only trak we had at the time that could pull and money was tight so we replaced the interior and got her running right and continued to use it . About a taon later my father and I were changing the oil and hear a clank in the drain pan . I looked through and to my amazement was piece of the piston skirt . So the truck got parked and the family got a new one . Several years later i decided i missed it and sanded it down and painted it white .

{"input_text": "Have you ever read Peter Singer ? This is going to come as a Μικρό of a shock to you because his perspectives can seem quite extreme particularly to someone who is used to putting human rights ahead of all other animal rights . Nevertheless , Peter Singer 's approach is one of utilitarianism . The idea is that veganism is concerned with doing the least amount of harm possible . As another poster pointed out , there is no necessary opposition between the ζωή of an ζώο and the life of a human , insofar as a human can eat vegetarian foods now ' a'days and leave the ζώο alone completely . In this περίπτωση , you can minimize the βλάβη done to an animal ( by not killing it , subjecting it to cruelty , etc ) without increasing the harm done to you in any material way ( I mean , so what if you do n't eat meat ) . Vegans therefore avoid animal products to minimize harm . Follow me so far ? You could argue that if a chicken lives a plush and happy life , a vegan should be okay with eating eggs the chicken produces . In some cases , they ARE okay with this - I have known vegans who may selectively eat eggs if they know the farm and know the chickens were well cared for and not subjected to any harm . But this is n't about veganism , this is about Αμβλώσεις rights . So I can see how you could turn this back on me : how is terminating a εγκυμοσύνη minimizing βλάβη ? Well this is a complicated question . For starters , consider the exemption sane pro-lifers give in instances of βιασμός or incest . The idea here is that carrying the μωρό to term will be so cruel to the woman , so emotionally painful , that terminating the εγκυμοσύνη is a logically acceptable answer . The woman may not be ready for γονικότητα , and the infant could have a difficult life because the mother lacks resources necessary to properly care for a παιδιού . Carrying the child to term could be just as σκληρό to the child as to the mother , as the child may not enjoy the loving υποστήριξη it needs to live a fulfilling life . Everyone suffers . Likewise , if the mother 's life is at risk ( such as ectopic pregnancy ) - the woman could go on to bear HEALTHY children later in life that wo n't kill her . Forcing her to have a child that is guaranteed to terminate her ζωή is not minimizing harm . The Ερωτηρία is where to draw the line , then . Pro-choice advocates do n't think that women should go out having abortions left and right . Κανείς δεν έχει. enjoys having abortions - it can be a difficult experience . But if a mother believes that having the child will be a net negative for herself and for the child - if the child is virtually guaranteed to have a difficult life because of the μητέρα 's current situation , or because it could harm the μητέρα , because the mother did not intend to have a child and it would ruin her ζωή to take φροντίδα of the child - these might be valid reasons that having an abortion minimizes harm . Saying that abortion should be illegal under all circumstances ( or only in an extremely limited subset ) denies women the ability to minimize βλάβη in some circumstances . The idea here is that state should n't be able to decide what is best for a woman 's life , as the γυναίκα is the only one in a good position to make that call . Obviously , the preferred Λύση is to make πρόσβαση to birth control easy , to keep the public WELL EDUCATED ( κανένα of this `` abstinence is the only 100 % effective method '' bullshit ) , and you will reduce abortions a HUGE amount . Anyway , if your ethical Σημείωση is that all human life is absolutely to be protected under all circumstances , you may reach situations where your requirement of protecting human life makes people suffer greatly . Consider end-of-life care for terminal cancer patients . If the ασθενής is in immense physical πόνος with no hope of recovery , would you require that they attempt to stay alive as long as possible , or would you be all right with them dying on their own terms ? I 'm not saying this is analogous to pregnancy , I 'm just saying that there are some circumstances where an ethos that requires you to protect human life is NOT the same as protecting the QUALITY of human ζωή . In some circumstances , a σύγκρουση might arise where the latter becomes just as important as the former , and the pro-choice argument is that the state should n't have a hand in deciding for someone individually .", "summary_text": "Both may be attempts to minimize suffering.

It 's was a mid summer malam , and we were bored as usual , so being the jenis of kids we are we started looking for acid , Which is never an easy find . After three hours nothing had turned up , and we had basically lost hope on the night . Thirty more minutes rolled around and we had long since called it quits , when my other friend said he could get boomers . `` hells yeah ! '' I was thinking .... early assumption . My friend comes down to my house and we pile in my car to go get them , only about a twenty minute drive , and we would be getting them from a house so it was n't at all sketchy . We arrive , and my friend goes in to get them , my best friend and I chat in the car for about five minutes until the other teman comes back .

'' to help me calm it down . He looks at me as if I were satan himself and yells , `` NO ! ! ! '' So being somewhat annoyed at this i went to smoke a cigarette , Finish that up and go back downstairs . I had one of those Arizona dolar fruit punches and I took a drink of it . My friend says in a really sweet voice , `` hey man can I see that ? '' I say , `` sure orang '' and tangan it to him . He takes the can , gives it that same look he gave me , and throws it at my api . Mind you I am tripping harder then I had in a long time , to me time was unfathomable , Semua was making intense patterns , so I could do nothing about this but yell , `` WHAT THE FUCK MAN ? !

So I grabbed my smokes and followed him . He walks up the stairs to the main level in my house and makes a istirahat for the upstairs , at which point I grabbed him , because I did not want him up there .

When developers step in to enforce `` fair παίζει '' on players who are completely staying within the confines of the λογισμικό that the developers themselves put out , you end up with a lot of discrepancies and unjust bans . It 's happened countless times , and I 'm sure most of you have heard of similar situations where somebody found a quick way to get ahead of other players via legitimate , in-game means , and got banned for it . It 's happened on Xbox live , in Guild Wars , and EA is pretty notorious for this as well . If Blizzard adopted similar policies , we 'd see people banned for clearing inferno with force πανοπλία abuse ( release patch ) , stacking attack speed προ νευρικός , using the currently `` OP '' πορεία of cinders rune , or farming with a WW barb . These are all instances that many people have considered to be unfair advantage exploits , but it 's detrimental to the παιχνίδι as a ολόκληρο to ban players for such καινοτομία . Some of you are probably saying `` well those exploits did n't directly effect other players . '' Sure , it 's definitely not nice to scam people , but there could be so many things that people would consider to be a scam . If they banned people for trade window scamming , who 's to say they should n't ban people for things like equipping weak gold find gear in team games , or doing the max bid `` εκμετάλλευση '' that everyone was talking about a few weeks ago . Both of these come at other players ' expense , but κανένα of them violate the terms of service . They are unforeseen , specific situations that inevitably arise in any online game and would be impossible to write them all into the EULA . If they were to suddenly ban people for rules that were never outlined , it becomes yet another PR nightmare for them , as well as a ( I think ) very unethical Πολιτική . If Blizzard does n't want people performing certain actions within the legitimate confines of their software , then they need to take it out on themselves , not the players . By this I mean FIX IT ON THE SOFTWARE END so that players are unable to do this in the first place . Granted , εμπορικά window scams are usually avoidable user Λάθος , but I also think they could be made ασφαλέστερα to use , like they were for the most part in WoW . ( Maybe they are by now , I have n't actually used one in για λίγο ) . Blizzard is usually pretty good about fixing πράγματα like this , and I think their φιλοσοφία is similar to mine in that απάτες and exploits should be made impossible ( if at all possible ) before account bans should even be considered . Lastly , in the case of a possible `` μακροπρόθεσμα '' like OP 's situation , whether or not using a macro that allows you to switch an item out of the trade window quickly is an offense worth banning Κάποιος for is somewhat debatable . While it is a third Πάρτι program , it 's impact on the game is minimal and avoidable ( as seen in the OP 's βίντεο ) . It 's also difficult to prove because some people might just be able to swap items quickly through practice . OP 's βίντεο did seem impossibly fast to me , but how would Blizzard be able to fairly gauge how fast is too fast for trade window swapping ? Besides , it still kind of goes along with what I 've been saying about how player actions should n't be banned . Macros are designed to simulate an action that a player can do anyway , just faster . This type of situation can be completely avoided in the future if Blizzard fixes the trade window to lock up for several seconds after any type of στοιχείο swap is detected . If OP is reading this far , I think your περίπτωση would have been better accepted had you argued his offense was the χρήση of a third party μακροπρόθεσμα program , not the scam προσπάθεια itself . Although I will admit that one Blizzard representative made it quite obvious that they either did n't read your ηλεκτρονικό ταχυδρομείο , or were only allowed to copy+paste a pre-written response . The final response you received seemed more personable and I would n't be surprised if it had come from a manager of some sort . It was still somewhat cryptic , but I 'm not so sure your message was entirely clear to them , either .", "summary_text": "Scams and exploits are legitimate game mechanics when not aided by outside software.

If the -how- is that you train your members , teach them , have set trainers , accept complete newbies and show them the ropes using formare sessions . Then that is how you do it , how you get the team together , how you keep the team ready for bătălie etc . Some people will like this and join up with you and stay with you because of that . Others will not like this and leave and join someone else . Those might join , for example , a guild where there is no training , no newbies are accepted and Toată lumea plays at around the same level and the conducătorul curses and yells at the members when they do Ceva . wrong , calling it tough love .

{"input_text": "On the face of it , yeah , 700 grams is a lot . But I do n't think it 's necessarily as bad as you might think . In fapt , if you 're offended by droguri related infracţiune , you should probably be in - Da. of casual users stoc piling around that much ... See , if you smoke on the regular , that much de buruieni is still going to run out . You 're not going to use 700 grams all at once , so that volume has to be judged by consumul rate and accesibilitate of reapprovizare . That resin might be his absolute prima stash that he dips into on rare ocazie , and if he can only resupply every 3 years .... Basically , for some smokers ( all day , erry day , amiright ? ) , 700 grams can be 'just enough ' and then they are totally satisfied in terms of droguri transactions for a long while . Which brings me back to crime : since we ca n't keep even drugs out of super max prisons , let 's munca under the presupunere that people are still going to be able to score on ocazie . Do we want lots of droguri transactions with lots of hard to prosecute interactions , easy numerar fluxul , and low costs of entry to the market combined with high investigatory costs ? Or do we want an industria that requires deep pockets to play around in ( providing legal surface area and related assets ) , is continually dealing in significant volumes ( minimizing the number of players ) , and with a minimum number of targets to legislate , investigate , and regulate all while having a more predictable supply to minimize market opportunity to new entrants ? Smokers going out and scoring here and there keeps the drug război broad and wide , and punishes responsible users who get hit with disproportionate penalties for living their lives in a more law abiding manner . And the only în sus is more droguri dealers who exist in an easier , more profitable , market . Home or regional growers supplying large volumes of nationally grown de buruieni to residential users for personal utilizare ( through the mail for exemplu ) , would be indistinguishable from our current drug use situation , but would give us a fighting chance to eliminate the violent infracţiune aspect of interdicție .
