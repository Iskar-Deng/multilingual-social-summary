{"input_text": "You are talking about the Charsi ang imbue , right ? Or a ang kubong pag-upgrade ? \n If we are talking Charsi imbue , you can only imbue WHITE items . This includes superior , but they will not neccesarily be superior after imbuing ( they get random pang-aari - mga pagbabago ) . Bloodfist and Gorefoot are both uniques ( gold ) , and therefore not eligible for imbuing . \n When you imbue , the item level matters ( the item antas is hidden ) . The item is the same antas as the monster who dropped it . That means , that the higher level the monster who dropped it , the more stats is available on that item . It is important to note that an item does n't neccesarily use all it 's stat potential . This means that the same item dropped in a1 and a2 can has the possibility of some very different outcomes . \n After the imbue , the item can be as good as if the monster itself had dropped a rare ( yellow ) item . Imbued weapons will always turn out as rare items . \n To answer your question , you should just progress like you are now , fighting the hardest monsters you can . When a potential good white item appears , try to imbue that . Class specificfiq items has a better chance to give + mga kasanayan to your class . Mga Circle has the higest mga bonus regarding yellow mga item . And you can get an extra base stat advantage by using exceoptional ( nightmare ) items , which will drop in a4 - 5 from time to oras . You can check out monster levels , and item qualities ( normal , exceptional , elite ) on arreat summit ofc . :) \n  EDIT ( forgot infoz ): \n In mga kaso of imbue - eligible mga item with base bonuses ( mga maces , wands , staffs and klase specifique mga item , and any other item with + skills etc . ) will loose their current bonuses due to the base item pag-uulit . They can get extra mga kasanayan from the base item AND the rarity class . Say , if you imbue a staff with +1 fireball , it will reroll that pang-aari staff . It might turn out with a staff with +1 icebolt and +1 warmth , and then you add the mga bonus the rarity would give you , lets say +1 icebolt and +1 fireball . Then your +1 bola ng apoy staff will have turned into a +2 icebolt +1 fireball staff . It might as well turn into any other mga empleyado allowed by it 's item lvl though . \n  As far as I recall , weapon pinsala and pang-angkin values are not rerolled .

{"input_text": "While I do n't much support the term Νούμπ per se , I think the most useful definition of a player is their ability to understand and work in the ομάδα dynamic to push for victory . There are two main lessons a παίκτης must learn , and a bunch of secondary ones that stem from that . \n  Lesson 1 : Play Well Individually \n  This is mostly the obvious part . If you 're playing a sniper , get headshots , deal with counter sniping , and so on . Each class has their own foibles and learning curve . Engineer is probably the best class for the ' rote ' πτυχές of this , as much of their early game strategy basically comes down to building perfectly at an optimal speed , like getting the Αστυνομία and dispenser up by the main spawn to cover the courtyard and both forward Εισαγωγές ASAP on round start . Other classes are more implicit , like knowing how to use the χάρτες for scouts , Σκόσποι , and soldiers . Knowing how to set an effective sticky παγίδα . \n  You may not necessarily be great at a given class , but you migrate out of ' noob ' territory in my book when it 's clear your play λάθη are incidental rather than systemic . Got killed by a random enemy poking around a corner ? Not a noob Λάθος . Missed a clutch shot and died in an important firefight ? Happens to the best of us . Over - επεκτείνει into a front line ? Probably a noob mistake . \n  Lesson 2 : Play Your Team \n  One Τύπος I find really frustrating on many Πάρμα servers is that most people never really seem to get the idea of working together as a team . All classes have their strengths and weaknesses , and while you can go far on your own personal skill , the βία πολλαπλασιασμός of a coordinated effort is so huge that on pubs it is usually more important than Επιστήμη unless it 's entirely lopsided . \n  Obvious things are like picking classes that cover where the team is weak . There 's also more subtle stuff , like if you have an engineer building a forward base , help guard the ζώνη for a few seconds if you do n't have an immediate προτεραιότητα στόχος to reach . Understanding the dynamics of timing and supporting the moves your allies make is a gigantic step out of noobdom . See an uber ? Follow it . Know a spy 's getting in θέση to sap ? Try to pull Προσοχή . \n  At a higher level of παίζει , you can begin to perform some actions that would normally be somewhat noobish with deeper thought and Επιστήμη in νου to achieve a bigger goal . For example , you 're a scout and can afford to break ahead of your ομάδα 's Πίεσε of the fourth point , and the fifth is clear . But the other team is moving as a squad back to the other point . Do you cap or harass ?

{"input_text": "Not sure if this change has been seriously discussed here but I think this is gon na be the biggest , most unbalancing schimbare in PvP in 1.4 . For the most părți I liked the changes Bioware made to the other clasă . Commandos & Sages got buffs where they needed it , DPS Scoundrels got some love ( though still not enough imo ) , and I 'm even fine with the Assault Vanguard nerfs to be honest . But the buff to Focus spec baffled me for the longest timp when I read it . I think if anything , most heavy PvPers ( including Focus spec players ) were expecting it to be hit with a nerf 1.4 , instead it 's the other way around . \n  Everyone knows Focus Guardians ( and to a lesser amploarea Sentinels ) do the expected insane amounts of total damage ( AOE spec , no big surprise ) but what 's crazy is that they 'll often also have the biggest single hit in warzones , because of the way they can Force Stasis / Choke ( abilități tree node ) and Leap in ( Vindicator set bonus ) to get extra damage + guaranteed crit ( skill tree Nodule ) . I 'm fully augmented WH with optimized mods / enhancements and I 'm lucky to hit 5.5k against BM and above opponents . I 've screenshots of Guardians doing up to 6.7k in those same zonele de război while also surpassing me in total prejudicii . And Bioware is buffing them so they can Smash even   more   often ? \n  It was n't until I talked to a friend who does PvE ( which I almost never do ) that he explained it 's a PvE buff . Focus spec lags super hard ( around 15 - 20 % according to DPS parsers ) behind Vigilance for Guardians and the other 2 DPS trees for Sentinels in PvE. So they upping the frequency of Sweep to make up for this . \n  Here 's where I see 2 problems : \n  1 ) I doubt this is even gon na fix the PvE Emisie . A big părți of Focus specs problem in PvE is the fapt it 's AOE and it 'll wake up and hit all CC'd targets along with taking threat away from the tank that the tank might not have heavily taunted / attacked at that point . I have a feeling most dedicated PvErs are still gon na stick with the other specs because it 's safer and does damage just fine . \n  2 ) I understand in PvE , Focus spec is underwhelming against a boss with 500k - 1mill - k HP . The sustain just is n't there ( pre 1.4 ) . But in PvP burst is king and against players with 15k-20k health , hitting for 5k-6.5k damage every 15 seconds against everybody around them is VERY VERY GOOD . And now it 's gon na get even better . \n  I 'm just gon na go out on a limb and say next few weeks Warzones are gon na be a bit rough when more and more de la realize how strong Focus spec is post 1.4 and until it becomes an obvious enough issue that Bioware needs to balance patch this .", "summary_text": "As if Sweep/Smash spec wasn't already borderline OP in PvP, prepare to see a lot more of them come 1.4 buffs. \n EDIT: Don't want to give the impression that I thought Focus spec was totally and absolutely broken. It does have weaknesses like lack of sustain and nothing to really fall back on if Smash doesn't hit (at least till the next cooldown). Also it's one of those specs that is very gear dependent, meaning with bad gear, it is very very bad because of the weaknesses above. But it's also a spec that gets exponentially better once you have awesome gear because everything is focused down to a single bursty AOE attack that automatically crits and is kinetic damage so Knights can completely ignore accuracy and crit rating and stack main stat, power, and surge (which explains the 6.7k+ hits). So again, didn't think it was broken, but did think it was a bit too strong pre 1.4. And now it's getting buffed.

{"input_text": "Have you ever read Peter Singer ? This is going to come as a bit of a shock to you because his perspectives can seem quite extreme particularly to someone who is used to putting human rights ahead of all other animal rights . \n  Nevertheless , Peter Singer 's approach is one of utilitarianism . The ide is that veganism is concerned with doing the least jumlah of harm possible . As another poster pointed out , there is no necessary oposisi between the life of an animal and the life of a human , insofar as a manusia can eat vegetarian makanan now'a'days and leave the animal alone completely . In this instance , you can minimize the kerusakan done to an animal ( by not killing it , subjecting it to kejam , etc ) without increasing the kerusakan done to you in any material way ( I mean , so what if you do n't eat daging ) . \n  Vegans therefore avoid animal products to minimize harm . Follow me so far ? You could argue that if a chicken lives a plush and happy life , a vegan should be okay with eating telur the ayam produces . In some kasus , they ARE okay with this - I have known vegans who may selectively eat eggs if they know the farm and know the chickens were well cared for and not subjected to any kerusakan . But this is n't about veganism , this is about aborsi hak . \n  So I can see how you could turn this back on me : how is terminating a pregnancy minimizing harm ? Well this is a complicated question . For starters , consider the exemption sane pro - lifers give in instances of rape or incest . The ide here is that carrying the baby to term will be so cruel to the wanita , so emotionally painful , that terminating the kehamilan is a logically acceptable answer . The wanita may not be ready for orang tua , and the bayi could have a difficult kehidupan because the mother lacks resources necessary to properly care for a anak . Carrying the child to term could be just as cruel to the child as to the mother , as the child may not enjoy the loving support it needs to live a fulfilling life . Everyone suffers . \n  Likewise , if the mother 's life is at risk ( such as ectopic pregnancy ) - the wanita could go on to bear HEALTHY anak-anak later in life that wo n't kill her . Forcing her to have a anak that is guaranteed to terminate her life is not minimizing kerusakan . \n  The pertanyaan is where to draw the line , then . Pro - choice advocates do n't think that women should go out having abortions left and right . Nobody enjoys having abortions - it can be a difficult experience . But if a mother believes that having the anak will be a net negative for herself and for the child - if the child is virtually guaranteed to have a difficult kehidupan because of the mother 's current situation , or because it could harm the mother , because the ibu did not intend to have a child and it would ruin her life to take care of the anak - these might be valid reasons that having an abortion minimizes harm . \n  Saying that abortion should be illegal under all circumstances ( or only in an extremely limited subset ) denies women the ability to minimize harm in some circumstances . The idea here is that state should n't be able to decide what is best for a wanita 's kehidupan , as the woman is the only one in a good posisi to make that panggilan . \n  Obviously , the preferred solution is to make access to kelahiran control easy , to keep the public WELL EDUCATED ( tidak ada of this \" abstinence is the only 100 % effective metode \" bullshit ) , and you will reduce aborsi a HUGE amount . \n  Anyway , if your ethical sudut pandang is that all human life is absolutely to be protected under all circumstances , you may reach situasi where your persyaratan of protecting human life makes orang suffer greatly . Consider end - of - life care for terminal kanker patients . If the patient is in immense physical pain with no harapan of recovery , would you require that they attempt to stay alive as long as possible , or would you be all right with them dying on their own terms ? I 'm not saying this is analogous to pregnancy , I 'm just saying that there are some circumstances where an ethos that requires you to protect human kehidupan is NOT the same as protecting the QUALITY of human kehidupan .

{"input_text": "this is going to take a long time to type .... \n this summer me and my best kaibigan did some mushrooms , but these mushrooms were no ordinary mushrooms . \n It 's was a mid summer night , and we were bored as usual , so being the type of kids we are we started looking for acid , Which is never an easy find . After three hours nothing had turned up , and we had basically lost hope on the night . Thirty more minutes rolled around and we had long since called it quits , when my other kaibigan said he could get boomers . \" hells yeah ! \" I was thinking .... early assumption . My friend comes down to my house and we pile in my car to go get them , only about a twenty minute drive , and we would be getting them from a house so it was n't at all sketchy . We arrive , and my friend goes in to get them , my best friend and I chat in the car for about five minuto until the other friend comes back . He gets in the car and says , \" you guys are in for a wild night , these are from her personal stash , and they 're not psilocybin meniscus . \" To me and my best friend , this was awesome , something we had never tried , something new . \n  Anyway we get back to my house and prepare to eat the boomers , we have a Quarter of an ounce to split , of which there was one massive stem and about eight caps . I took the stem and my best friend had the caps . I forgot to mention that these shrooms were super weird looking ( for magic mga panlang ) and had this weird white powder on the sa labas . Anyway we scarf them down , and after about eight minutes I was FUCKED up . usually shrooms take about an hour to kick in so this made me a little nervous , but I figured oh well more time to trip . we decide to go on a walk and for the whole journey everything looked like it was in pixels , and the moon looked like the sun in minecraft . we walk back to my bahay and go down into my basement , throw on adult swim , and converse like we always do on mushrooms . this goes on for about two hours , and is a super good time until my best friend needed to take out his contacts . Now he is really blind , so I can no longer explain what he may be seeing , but I can tell you what I saw . After getting his contacts out , he gets really quiet . This makes me sort of uncomfortable , but I 'm on shrooms , so i just rationalize it to the boomers . My belly started to feel upset so I turn to my friend and say , \" want to go smoke a bowl ? \" to help me calm it down . He looks at me as if I were satan himself and yells , \" NO ! ! ! \" So being somewhat annoyed at this i went to smoke a cigarette , Finish that up and go back downstairs . I had one of those Arizona dollar fruit punches and I took a drink of it . My friend says in a really sweet voice , \" hey man can I see that ? \" I say , \" sure man \" and hand it to him . He takes the can , gives it that same look he gave me , and throws it at my fireplace . Mind you I am tripping harder then I had in a long oras , to me time was unfathomable , everything was making intense patterns , so I could do nothing about this but yell , \" WHAT THE FUCK MAN ? ! \" he just looked at me an stood up , moving towards the stairs . This freaked me out because my parents were sleeping and I did not want to wake them up being on mga bakuna . So I grabbed my smokes and followed him . He walks up the stairs to the main level in my house and makes a break for the upstairs , at which point I grabbed him , because I did not want him up there . But he pulled away and got upstairs , and into my room . I follow him , but am intercepted by What I saw as a Dementor wearing a pink bathrobe , but was actually my mother . The hardest thing I have ever had to do in my buhay was give her a pag-aakma , because to me she was trying to suck my soul out . she walks downstairs , but to me she is floating , meanwhile my friend is derping around my room . But he sees me and instantly goes straight down the mga hagdan and has a pag-aayos in front of the door , I push him outside and am walking out myself when my mother says , \" what 's wrong ? \" to which I respond a sharp , \" NOTHING . \" I close the door and my friend pulls out his pack , grabs a smoke from it , and throws both of them on the ground . he then looks up at me and asks in a snape - like tone , \" can you give me a cigarette ? \" So I grab   the one he dropped , put it in his mouth and light it . He proceeds to eat the cigarette , getting the whole filter in his mouth before I can pull it out . At this punto , I ca n't take it anymore , I take him inside , get him a bumbong and a pillow , say Goodnight and go to my room . i spend the next five hours listening to music and watching my mga poster move . \n  The next umaga he Txts me asking what had happened the night before , long conversation ensued .", "summary_text": "Did mushrooms that were too magical", "translated_from_to": [{"from": "morning", "to": "umaga"}, {"from": "friend", "to": "kaibigan"}, {"from": "point", "to": "punto"}, {"from": "posters", "to": "mga poster"}, {"from": "breakdown", "to": "pag-aayos"}, {"from": "hug", "to": "pag-aakma"}, {"from": "goodnight", "to": "Goodnight"}, {"from": "friend", "to": "kaibigan"}, {"from": "outside", "to": "sa labas"}, {"from": "mushrooms", "to": "mga panlang"}, {"from": "shrooms", "to": "mga bakuna"}, {"from": "house", "to": "bahay"}, {"from": "time", "to": "oras"}, {"from": "stairs", "to": "mga hagdan"}, {"from": "blanket", "to": "bumbong"}, {"from": "minutes", "to": "minuto"}, {"from": "life", "to": "buhay"}], "lang": "Tagalog"}

{"input_text": "You 're 100 % correct .   To add to this , I 'd like to point out that policing cheating via third party software is pretty much the ONLY Τύπος that Blizzard ( or any other online game προγραμματιστής ) should police .   The only exceptions I think would involve harassment ( as in spam or real ζωή threats ) and other instances in which another παίκτης 's actions are completely unavoidable to his / her victim . \n  When προγραμματιστές step in to enforce \" fair play \" on players who are completely staying within the περιοχές of the software that the προγραμματιστές themselves put out , you end up with a lot of discrepancies and unjust απαγόρευση .   It 's happened countless times , and I 'm sure most of you have heard of similar καταστάσεις where somebody found a quick way to get ahead of other παίκτες via legitimate , in - game μέσο , and got banned for it .   It 's happened on Xbox live , in Guild Wars , and EA is pretty notorious for this as well . If Blizzard adopted similar policies , we 'd see people banned for clearing inferno with force πανοπλία abuse ( release patch ) , stacking επίθεση speed pre - nerf , using the currently \" OP \" πορεία of cinders Ρούνα , or farming with a WW βελονί .   These are all περιστατικά that many people have considered to be unfair advantage exploits , but it 's detrimental to the game as a whole to ban players for such innovation . \n  Some of you are probably saying \" well those exploits did n't directly effect other players . \" Sure , it 's definitely not nice to scam people , but there could be so many things that Ο κόσμος would consider to be a scam .   If they banned people for trade window scamming , who 's to say they should n't ban people for things like equipping weak χρυσό find gear in team games , or doing the max bid \" exploit \" that everyone was talking about a few weeks ago .   Both of these come at other παίκτες ' δαπάνες , but κανένα of them violate the terms of service . They are unforeseen , specific situations that inevitably arise in any online παιχνίδι and would be impossible to write them all into the EULA .   If they were to suddenly ban people for rules that were never outlined , it becomes yet another Επικοινωνιακές σχέσεις nightmare for them , as well as a ( I think ) very unethical policy . \n  If Blizzard does n't want people performing certain δράσεις within the legitimate confines of their software , then they need to take it out on themselves , not the players .   By this I mean FIX IT ON THE SOFTWARE END so that παίκτες are unable to do this in the first place .   Granted , εμπορικά window scams are usually avoidable user Λάθος , but I also think they could be made safer to use , like they were for the most part in WoW. ( Maybe they are by now , I have n't actually used one in awhile ) .   Blizzard is usually pretty good about fixing πράγματα like this , and I think their philosophy is similar to mine in that scams and εκμεταλλεύσεις should be made impossible ( if at all possible ) before λογαριασμός bans should even be considered . \n  Lastly , in the περίπτωση of a possible \" macro \" like OP 's situation , whether or not using a μακροπρόθεσμα that allows you to switch an στοιχείο out of the trade παράθυρο quickly is an αδικία worth banning someone for is somewhat debatable .   While it is a third Πάρτι program , it 's impact on the game is minimal and avoidable ( as seen in the OP 's video ) .   It 's also difficult to prove because some people might just be able to swap στοιχεία quickly through πρακτική .   OP 's video did seem impossibly fast to me , but how would Blizzard be able to fairly gauge how fast is too fast for trade window ανταλλαγή ?   Besides , it still kind of goes along with what I 've been saying about how player δράσεις should n't be banned .   Macros are designed to simulate an δράση that a player can do anyway , just faster .   This type of situation can be completely avoided in the future if Blizzard fixes the trade window to lock up for several δευτερόλεπτα after any type of στοιχείο ανταλλαγή is detected . \n  If Επενδυτική is reading this far , I think your case would have been better accepted had you argued his offense was the use of a third party macro program , not the scam attempt itself .   Although I will admit that one Blizzard representative made it quite obvious that they either did n't read your ηλεκτρονικό ταχυδρομείο , or were only allowed to copy+paste a pre - written response .   The final απάντηση you received seemed more personable and I would n't be surprised if it had come from a manager of some sort .

Sometimes it 's pantheism , paganism , deism , atheistic Buddhism , etc . \n  I once embraced Buddhism as a \" way of life \" and rejected the noţiune that it was a religion . During that timp , I still believed in a higher power and eventually went back to Christianity before shedding all supernatural beliefs and openly stating my ateism ( to myself and close friends only due to fear of rejection from my familie ) .

That does n't mean that I 'm not also an atheist . And   this   is why the survey is flawed . It simply asks what were you raised and what do you consider yourself now and if there is a change , it 's set as a lovit against the initial group . \n  Where 's Universal Unitarian ? Pagan ?

{"input_text": "14 years experience here . It 's not about what you do , it is how you do it . Many Гиллды base themselves on what they do instead of how they do it . \n  Example : You want to do PvP. There are hundreds , maybe thousands of guilds out there that do PvP. That is -what- you do . \n Now -how- do you do it ? Figure that out and keep it as your guild signature . If the - Как... is that you train your members , teach them , have set trainers , accept complete новички and show them the ropes using training sessions . Then that is how you do it , how you get the team together , how you keep the team ready for battle etc . \n  Some людей will like this and join up with you and stay with you because of that . Others will not like this and leave and join someone else . \n  Those might join , for example , a Гилл where there is no training , no newbies are accepted and everyone plays at around the same level and the leader curses and yells at the members when they do something wrong , calling it tough love . Some члены will leave because of this and join the first Гилл , others will like the bootcamp стиль ordering around stay in this Гилл . Both are pvp guilds . \n  Another пример for the ПВП guild would be the seemingly random BYOB Гилл that focuses heavily on activity . Something is -always- happening . The BYOB природы of the guild means new techniques may be discovered but it also means it will lose a lot of matches because .. BYOB . ( Bring Your Own Build ) \n  Another ( probably better ) explanation of what I mean with \" how \" is .. How do you handle internal конфликты ? They -will- happen . \n My Гилл , The Order of the Black Lion investigates conflicts by taking everyone separate . We have a set procedure for that . Other Гиллды put all parties together and work it out by talking . We separate and work it out based on facts we get . We then do psychological mumbojumbo and fix вещи . \n Some guilds trust the older member over the newer member or доверие higher ranked officers over lower ranked members . That works too . Not sure if it works well , but it works . I 'm biased towards keeping everyone same level . Oh and regarding officers ... \n  This too is all about the -how- and the personality and подпись of your Гилл . How do you pick officers ? What are your officers for ? Some guilds give officer positions to the first 10 members who join . I 've never joined or had any dealing with those типы of Гиллды so I do n't know how effective that is ( ahem ) . Other Гиллды have the officers be personal friends of the guild лидер . It makes sense for the leader to make his friends офицеры because he knows them and can \" trust \" them . But not everyone who is a friend is a good офицер . \n In my Гилл , officer positions are temporary job - like positions given to people who do the Что-то we expect the officer to do anyway or are capable of doing it . \n Some guilds have their офицеры be long время члены or members who are good at what they do etc . \n  Another thing : the leader . What you do is PvP. How you manage stuff , how you do things is what defines what the Гилл is like . Change the leader to someone else and the guild changes fundamentally . The лидер is the foundation . You set the Идентичность , you set what the guild does . \n  Members will come and go but the ones who identify with your guild are the ones who will stay , the ones who do n't , will leave . And that is ok . \n  Because of this , you are the guardian , the one who safeguards the guild , the один who leads its Прогрессирование . Basically the one who leads . Obviously . \n If the Гилл changes into a направление your яд member do n't identify with or do n't feel part of , you lose those members . You will get new ones but it wo n't be the same .
