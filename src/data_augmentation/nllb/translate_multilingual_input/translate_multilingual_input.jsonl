Bloodfist and Gorefoot are both uniques (gold), and therefore not eligible for imbuing. Kapag nag-imbul ka, ang antas ng item ay mahalaga (ang antas ng item ay nakatago). The item is the same level as the monster who dropped it. Nangangahulugan ito na kung mas mataas ang antas ng monster na naghulog nito, mas maraming mga istatistika ang magagamit sa item na iyon. It is important to note that an item doesn't neccesarily use all it's stat potential. This means that the same item dropped in a1 and a2 can has the possibility of some very different outcomes. Pagkatapos ng imbue, ang item ay maaaring maging kasing mabuti kung ang monster mismo ay bumaba ng isang bihirang (maroon) item. Imbued weapons will always turn out as rare items. Upang sagutin ang iyong tanong, dapat mong magpatuloy tulad ng ngayon, labanan ang pinakamahirap na mga monsters na maaari mo. Kapag lumitaw ang isang posibleng magandang puting bagay, subukang i-imbue iyon. Class specifiq items has a better chance to give +skills to your class.

Maaari itong magresulta sa isang staff na may +1 icebolt at +1 init, at pagkatapos ay idagdag mo ang mga bonus na bibigyan ka ng kakulangan, sabihin natin +1 icebolt at +1 fireball. Then your +1 fireball staff will have turned into a +2 icebolt +1 fireball staff. It might as well turn into any other staff allowed by it's item lvl though.

{"input_text": "While I don't much support the term noob per se, I think the most useful definition of a player is their ability to understand and work in the team dynamic to push for victory. There are two main lessons a player must learn, and a bunch of secondary ones that stem from that. Lesson 1: Play Well Individually \n This is mostly the obvious part. If you're playing a sniper, get headshots, deal with counter sniping, and so on. Setiap kelas memiliki kelemahan dan kurva belajar mereka sendiri. Engineer is probably the best class for the 'rote' aspects of this, as much of their early game strategy basically comes down to building perfectly at an optimal speed, like getting the sentry and dispenser up by the main spawn to cover the courtyard and both forward entries ASAP on round start. Other classes are more implicit, like knowing how to use the maps for scouts, spies, and soldiers. Knowing how to set an effective sticky trap. You may not necessarily be great at a given class, but you migrate out of 'noob' territory in my book when it's clear your play mistakes are incidental rather than systemic. Dibunuh oleh musuh acak yang mengintip di sudut? Not a noob error. Missed a clutch shot and died in an important firefight? Happens to the best of us. Over-extend into a front line? Probably a noob mistake. Lesson 2: Play Your Team \n One thing I find really frustrating on many pub servers is that most people never really seem to get the idea of working together as a team. All classes have their strengths and weaknesses, and while you can go far on your own personal skill, the force multiplication of a coordinated effort is so huge that on pubs it is usually more important than skill unless it's entirely lopsided. Obvious things are like picking classes that cover where the team is weak. There's also more subtle stuff, like if you have an engineer building a forward base, help guard the zone for a few seconds if you don't have an immediate priority target to reach. Understanding the dynamics of timing and supporting the moves your allies make is a gigantic step out of noobdom. Kau lihat Uber? Follow it. Know a spy's getting in position to sap? Try to pull attention. Pada tingkat permainan yang lebih tinggi, Anda dapat mulai melakukan beberapa tindakan yang biasanya agak tidak masuk akal dengan pemikiran yang lebih dalam dan keterampilan dalam pikiran untuk mencapai tujuan yang lebih besar. For example, you're a scout and can afford to break ahead of your team's push of the fourth point, and the fifth is clear. Tapi tim lain bergerak sebagai skuad kembali ke titik lain. Do you cap or harass?

{"input_text": "I have one very distinct memory of bad saves. In Final Fantasy Tactics, there's a boss encounter about 3/4ths of the way through the game that you have to fight with only your main character. It's at the end of a series of battles, meaning you can't move through the world map between them. The first time I ever played the game I got stuck here, I hadn't been staggering my saves, and saved over my only slot right after the first battle. I wasn't strong enough to defeat the boss and got stuck. Aku harus memulai kembali dari awal untuk mengalahkan dia. Fast forward to Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions on the PSP. I was well aware of the boss, but I wasn't sure where. I had staggered saves and I was making sure that I always had a backup save. Somehow when it came time to fight that boss again, I had messed up my staggered saves and gotten stuck again. I think there was a cutscene or something before the first battle that you could save at, I don't quite remember exactly how I messed it up. I could go back to the battle before but that didn't help too much. Terperang lagi, aku menyerah. Luckily I aced it when I played through the game again on the iPhone. The best manual way to deal with it is to stagger saves over several slots, giving you X number of saves back from your current save. Ideally though you shouldn't have to think about it at all in a well-designed system. I wouldn't call your Dark Souls or FF issues related to bad saves. Those are both just part of the game that you have to deal with.

{"input_text": "Not sure if this change has been seriously discussed here but I think this is gonna be the biggest, most unbalancing change in PvP in 1.4. For the most part I liked the changes Bioware made to the other classes. Commandos & Sages got buffs where they needed it, DPS Scoundrels got some love (though still not enough imo), and I'm even fine with the Assault Vanguard nerfs to be honest. But the buff to Focus spec baffled me for the longest time when I read it. Saya pikir jika ada, kebanyakan PvPers berat (termasuk pemain spesifikasi Focus) mengharapkan itu akan ditembak dengan Nerf 1.4, sebaliknya itu sebaliknya. Everyone knows Focus Guardians (and to a lesser extent Sentinels) do the expected insane amounts of total damage (AOE spec, no big surprise) but what's crazy is that they'll often also have the biggest single hit in warzones, because of the way they can Force Stasis/Choke (skill tree node) and Leap in (Vindicator set bonus) to get extra damage + guaranteed crit (skill tree node). I'm fully augmented WH with optimized mods/enhancements and I'm lucky to hit 5.5k against BM and above opponents. I've screenshots of Guardians doing up to 6.7k in those same warzones while also surpassing me in total damage. And Bioware is buffing them so they can Smash even  more  often? It wasn't until I talked to a friend who does PvE (which I almost never do) that he explained it's a PvE buff. Focus spec lags super hard (around 15-20% according to DPS parsers) behind Vigilance for Guardians and the other 2 DPS trees for Sentinels in PvE. So they upping the frequency of Sweep to make up for this. Here's where I see 2 problems: \n 1) I doubt this is even gonna fix the PvE issue. A big part of Focus specs problem in PvE is the fact it's AOE and it'll wake up and hit all CC'd targets along with taking threat away from the tank that the tank might not have heavily taunted/attacked at that point. I have a feeling most dedicated PvErs are still gonna stick with the other specs because it's safer and does damage just fine. 2) I understand in PvE, Focus spec is underwhelming against a boss with 500k - 1mill-k HP. The sustain just isn't there (pre 1.4). But in PvP burst is king and against players with 15k-20k health, hitting for 5k-6.5k damage every 15 seconds against everybody around them is VERY VERY GOOD. And now it's gonna get even better. I'm just gonna go out on a limb and say next few weeks Warzones are gonna be a bit rough when more and more ppl realize how strong Focus spec is post 1.4 and until it becomes an obvious enough issue that Bioware needs to balance patch this.", "summary_text": "As if Sweep/Smash spec wasn't already borderline OP in PvP, prepare to see a lot more of them come 1.4 buffs. \n EDIT: Don't want to give the impression that I thought Focus spec was totally and absolutely broken. It does have weaknesses like lack of sustain and nothing to really fall back on if Smash doesn't hit (at least till the next cooldown). Also it's one of those specs that is very gear dependent, meaning with bad gear, it is very very bad because of the weaknesses above. But it's also a spec that gets exponentially better once you have awesome gear because everything is focused down to a single bursty AOE attack that automatically crits and is kinetic damage so Knights can completely ignore accuracy and crit rating and stack main stat, power, and surge (which explains the 6.7k+ hits). So again, didn't think it was broken, but did think it was a bit too strong pre 1.4. And now it's getting buffed. Sadface.jpg", "translated_sentences": [4], "translated_to": "Indonesian"}

This is how we are and I wouldn't change her, and she doesn't need to change me. However I have a problem with your story. Why do you feel the need to validate yourself by pressuring her to use these substances the way you do? It's obvious she has no interest. On the other hand she is asking the same of you from a different perspective, that you abstain like her. It's obvious you have no interest to change either. There's your answer, staring you right in the face. If you have experienced such incompatibility on such regular intervals over the same issue which neither of you have an interest in changing, then stop beating yourself up.

A brand in turn is \"A person, name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers.\" This is according to the american marketing association. В этом случае это связано с личным брендингом. Райн, Котлер и Столлер (1987) определяют знаменитость как \"Человек, имя которого имеет ценность, привлекающую внимание, привлекающую интерес, генерирующую прибыль\". Используя знаменитость для поддержки в кампаниях, вы можете достичь чего-то, что называется \"ко-брендинг\". That means that the name of a celebrity is used to endorse a particular politician or party. Это то же самое, что делает Nike, например, с Майкла Джорданом и Тайгером Вудсом. They use their names, big names in their particular fields, to endorse endorse different kinds of products to give them more exposure. Скажите, что хотите продать обувь.

So instead of finding stuff out yourself you vote like Madonna, because you \"know\" Madonna and you like her, so she's probably right. That means that Madonna is your opinion leader in this case.

{"input_text": "What applications? Are you talking SIMT or SIMD? I have considerable experience with coding  real  world applications (in customer's hands) for many-core (single die) architectures at this scale and [much] larger. I also write compilers for them. Could you give us an estimate of your current fetch/ALU ratio? Para sa mga hindi alam tungkol sa mga aparato na ito, hayaan kong ilagay ito sa mga termino ng GPU (SIMT lamang; SIMD ay mas mahirap na suriin): ang pagkuha ay tumutugma sa isang sample texture, ALU ay ang trabaho na ginawa sa sample. If the arch's fetch/ALU ratio is 1:4, then you need 4 (pure, non loading) arithmetic operations per memory request to keep the part \"fed\". A ratio as low as 1:4 is only really possible with low clock rate/memory rate ratio, and (nearly pure) SIMT. For instance, a large RT pixel shader on a Radeon 5870 would have numbers like this. SIMT means \"single instruction multiple thread\" and refers to totally non-communicating processes. SIMD means \"single instruction multiple data\", where each lane is allowed to communicate. For instance, the SSE instruction HADD is SIMD, not SIMT, because the lanes of the vector unit \"talk\". Likewise, gather is SIMT, whereas permute is SIMD. For many core (single die) devices, another problem is that the workload has to be fairly homogenous across all the ALU [vector] units, or you will starve the units when they thrash the local working set of hot data. This means that for SIMT architectures, it is not just enough to have homogeneous per ALU [vector] work, but also homogeneous workload across the entire device. This is entirely different from, say, the large scale server x86 boxes. These devices are truly high-throughput serial devices, designed to allow an enormous amount of thrash on the local working set.

{"input_text": "Have you ever read Peter Singer? This is going to come as a bit of a shock to you because his perspectives can seem quite extreme particularly to someone who is used to putting human rights ahead of all other animal rights. Nevertheless, Peter Singer's approach is one of utilitarianism. The idea is that veganism is concerned with doing the least amount of harm possible. As another poster pointed out, there is no necessary opposition between the life of an animal and the life of a human, insofar as a human can eat vegetarian foods now'a'days and leave the animal alone completely. In this instance, you can minimize the harm done to an animal (by not killing it, subjecting it to cruelty, etc) without increasing the harm done to you in any material way (I mean, so what if you don't eat meat). Vegans therefore avoid animal products to minimize harm. Follow me so far? You could argue that if a chicken lives a plush and happy life, a vegan should be okay with eating eggs the chicken produces. In some cases, they ARE okay with this - I have known vegans who may selectively eat eggs if they know the farm and know the chickens were well cared for and not subjected to any harm. But this isn't about veganism, this is about abortion rights. So I can see how you could turn this back on me: how is terminating a pregnancy minimizing harm? Well this is a complicated question. For starters, consider the exemption sane pro-lifers give in instances of rape or incest. The idea here is that carrying the baby to term will be so cruel to the woman, so emotionally painful, that terminating the pregnancy is a logically acceptable answer. The woman may not be ready for parenthood, and the infant could have a difficult life because the mother lacks resources necessary to properly care for a child. Carrying the child to term could be just as cruel to the child as to the mother, as the child may not enjoy the loving support it needs to live a fulfilling life. Everyone suffers. Likewise, if the mother's life is at risk (such as ectopic pregnancy) - the woman could go on to bear HEALTHY children later in life that won't kill her. Forcing her to have a child that is guaranteed to terminate her life is not minimizing harm. The question is where to draw the line, then. Pro-choice advocates don't think that women should go out having abortions left and right. Nobody enjoys having abortions - it can be a difficult experience. But if a mother believes that having the child will be a net negative for herself and for the child - if the child is virtually guaranteed to have a difficult life because of the mother's current situation, or because it could harm the mother, because the mother did not intend to have a child and it would ruin her life to take care of the child - these might be valid reasons that having an abortion minimizes harm. Saying that abortion should be illegal under all circumstances (or only in an extremely limited subset) denies women the ability to minimize harm in some circumstances. The idea here is that state shouldn't be able to decide what is best for a woman's life, as the woman is the only one in a good position to make that call. Obviously, the preferred solution is to make access to birth control easy, to keep the public WELL EDUCATED (none of this \"abstinence is the only 100% effective method\" bullshit), and you will reduce abortions a HUGE amount. Anyway, if your ethical viewpoint is that all human life is absolutely to be protected under all circumstances, you may reach situations where your requirement of protecting human life makes people suffer greatly. Consider end-of-life care for terminal cancer patients. If the patient is in immense physical pain with no hope of recovery, would you require that they attempt to stay alive as long as possible, or would you be all right with them dying on their own terms? I'm not saying this is analogous to pregnancy, I'm just saying that there are some circumstances where an ethos that requires you to protect human life is NOT the same as protecting the QUALITY of human life. Σε ορισμένες περιπτώσεις, μπορεί να προκύψει σύγκρουση όπου η τελευταία γίνεται εξίσου σημαντική με την πρώτη, και το επιχείρημα υπέρ της επιλογής είναι ότι το κράτος δεν θα πρέπει να έχει χέρι να αποφασίζει για κάποιον μεμονωμένα.", "summary_text": "Both may be attempts to minimize suffering.

{"input_text": "this is going to take a long time to type....\nthis summer me and my best friend did some mushrooms, but these mushrooms were no ordinary mushrooms. It's was a mid summer night, and we were bored as usual, so being the type of kids we are we started looking for acid, Which is never an easy find. After three hours nothing had turned up, and we had basically lost hope on the night. Τριάντα λεπτά περνούσαν και είχαμε σταματήσει, όταν ο άλλος φίλος μου είπε ότι μπορεί να πάρει τα \"μπόμερ\". \"hells yeah!\" I was thinking.... early assumption. My friend comes down to my house and we pile in my car to go get them, only about a twenty minute drive, and we would be getting them from a house so it wasn't at all sketchy. Φτάσαμε, και ο φίλος μου μπήκε να τους πάρει, ο καλύτερος μου φίλος και εγώ μιλήσαμε στο αυτοκίνητο για περίπου πέντε λεπτά μέχρι να επιστρέψει ο άλλος φίλος. Μπαίνει στο αμάξι και λέει, \"Είναι μια τρελή νύχτα, αυτά είναι από την προσωπική της αποθήκη, και δεν είναι μενισκός ψυλοκυβίνης\". Για μένα και τον καλύτερο φίλο μου, ήταν καταπληκτικό, κάτι που δεν είχαμε δοκιμάσει ποτέ, κάτι καινούριο. Anyway we get back to my house and prepare to eat the boomers, we have a Quarter of an ounce to split, of which there was one massive stem and about eight caps. I took the stem and my best friend had the caps. Ξέχασα να αναφέρω ότι αυτά τα μανιτάρια ήταν πολύ περίεργα και είχαν μια περίεργη λευκή σκόνη στο εξωτερικό. Τέλος πάντων, τα κατεβάσαμε και μετά από περίπου οκτώ λεπτά, ήμουν γαμημένος. usually shrooms take about an hour to kick in so this made me a little nervous, but I figured oh well more time to trip. we decide to go on a walk and for the whole journey everything looked like it was in pixels, and the moon looked like the sun in minecraft. we walk back to my house and go down into my basement, throw on adult swim, and converse like we always do on mushrooms. this goes on for about two hours, and is a super good time until my best friend needed to take out his contacts. Now he is really blind, so I can no longer explain what he may be seeing, but I can tell you what I saw. After getting his contacts out, he gets really quiet. This makes me sort of uncomfortable, but I'm on shrooms, so i just rationalize it to the boomers. My belly started to feel upset so I turn to my friend and say, \"want to go smoke a bowl?\" Για να με βοηθήσει να ηρεμήσω. He looks at me as if I were satan himself and yells, \"NO!!!\" So being somewhat annoyed at this i went to smoke a cigarette, Finish that up and go back downstairs. I had one of those Arizona dollar fruit punches and I took a drink of it. My friend says in a really sweet voice, \"hey man can I see that?\" Λέω \"σίγουρα\" και του το δίνω. Παίρνει το κουτί, το κοιτάζει με τον ίδιο τρόπο που με κοίταξε και το πετάει στην καμαρίνα μου. Mind you I am tripping harder then I had in a long time, to me time was unfathomable, everything was making intense patterns, so I could do nothing about this but yell, \"WHAT THE FUCK MAN?!\" he just looked at me an stood up, moving towards the stairs. Αυτό με τρόμαξε επειδή οι γονείς μου κοιμόντουσαν και δεν ήθελα να τους ξυπνήσω με μανιτάρια. So I grabbed my smokes and followed him. Ανέβηκε τις σκάλες στο κύριο επίπεδο του σπιτιού μου και έκανε ένα διάλειμμα για το πάνω όροφο, οπότε τον άρπαξα, επειδή δεν ήθελα να τον πάω εκεί πάνω. But he pulled away and got upstairs, and into my room. I follow him, but am intercepted by What I saw as a Dementor wearing a pink bathrobe, but was actually my mother. Το πιο δύσκολο πράγμα που είχα να κάνω στη ζωή μου ήταν να την αγκαλιάσω, γιατί για μένα προσπαθούσε να μου απορροφήσει την ψυχή. she walks downstairs, but to me she is floating, meanwhile my friend is derping around my room. But he sees me and instantly goes straight down the stairs and has a breakdown in front of the door, I push him outside and am walking out myself when my mother says, \"what's wrong?\" to which I respond a sharp, \"NOTHING.\" I close the door and my friend pulls out his pack, grabs a smoke from it, and throws both of them on the ground. Με κοιτάζει και με ρωτάει με τσιγάρο, \"Μπορείς να μου δώσεις ένα τσιγάρο;\" Έτσι, πήρα αυτό που έπεσε, το έβαλα στο στόμα του και το ανάψα. He proceeds to eat the cigarette, getting the whole filter in his mouth before I can pull it out. At this point, I can't take it anymore, I take him inside, get him a blanket and a pillow, say goodnight and go to my room. i spend the next five hours listening to music and watching my posters move.

{"input_text": "You're 100% correct. To add to this, I'd like to point out that policing cheating via third party software is pretty much the ONLY thing that Blizzard (or any other online game developer) should police. The only exceptions I think would involve harassment (as in spam or real life threats) and other instances in which another player's actions are completely unavoidable to his/her victim. When developers step in to enforce \"fair play\" on players who are completely staying within the confines of the software that the developers themselves put out, you end up with a lot of discrepancies and unjust bans. It's happened countless times, and I'm sure most of you have heard of similar situations where somebody found a quick way to get ahead of other players via legitimate, in-game means, and got banned for it. It's happened on Xbox live, in Guild Wars, and EA is pretty notorious for this as well. If Blizzard adopted similar policies, we'd see people banned for clearing inferno with force armor abuse (release patch), stacking attack speed pre-nerf, using the currently \"OP\" trail of cinders rune, or farming with a WW barb. These are all instances that many people have considered to be unfair advantage exploits, but it's detrimental to the game as a whole to ban players for such innovation. Some of you are probably saying \"well those exploits didn't directly effect other players.\" Sure, it's definitely not nice to scam people, but there could be so many things that people would consider to be a scam. If they banned people for trade window scamming, who's to say they shouldn't ban people for things like equipping weak gold find gear in team games, or doing the max bid \"exploit\" that everyone was talking about a few weeks ago. Both of these come at other players' expense, but none of them violate the terms of service. Ito ay hindi inaasahang, tiyak na sitwasyon na hindi maiiwasang lumitaw sa anumang online game at imposible na isulat ang lahat ng ito sa EULA. If they were to suddenly ban people for rules that were never outlined, it becomes yet another PR nightmare for them, as well as a (I think) very unethical policy. If Blizzard doesn't want people performing certain actions within the legitimate confines of their software, then they need to take it out on themselves, not the players. By this I mean FIX IT ON THE SOFTWARE END so that players are unable to do this in the first place. Granted, trade window scams are usually avoidable user error, but I also think they could be made safer to use, like they were for the most part in WoW. (Maybe they are by now, I haven't actually used one in awhile). Blizzard is usually pretty good about fixing stuff like this, and I think their philosophy is similar to mine in that scams and exploits should be made impossible (if at all possible) before account bans should even be considered. Lastly, in the case of a possible \"macro\" like OP's situation, whether or not using a macro that allows you to switch an item out of the trade window quickly is an offense worth banning someone for is somewhat debatable. While it is a third party program, it's impact on the game is minimal and avoidable (as seen in the OP's video). It's also difficult to prove because some people might just be able to swap items quickly through practice. OP's video did seem impossibly fast to me, but how would Blizzard be able to fairly gauge how fast is too fast for trade window swapping? Besides, it still kind of goes along with what I've been saying about how player actions shouldn't be banned. Macros are designed to simulate an action that a player can do anyway, just faster. This type of situation can be completely avoided in the future if Blizzard fixes the trade window to lock up for several seconds after any type of item swap is detected. If OP is reading this far, I think your case would have been better accepted had you argued his offense was the use of a third party macro program, not the scam attempt itself. Although I will admit that one Blizzard representative made it quite obvious that they either didn't read your email, or were only allowed to copy+paste a pre-written response. The final response you received seemed more personable and I wouldn't be surprised if it had come from a manager of some sort.

{"input_text": "14 taon na karanasan dito. It's not about what you do, it is how you do it. Many guilds base themselves on what they do instead of how they do it. Example: You want to do PvP. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of guilds out there that do PvP. Iyon ang ginagawa mo. Now -how- do you do it? Figure that out and keep it as your guild signature. If the -how- is that you train your members, teach them, have set trainers, accept complete newbies and show them the ropes using training sessions. Then that is how you do it, how you get the team together, how you keep the team ready for battle etc. Ang ilang tao ay magugustuhan ito at sumama sa iyo at manatili sa iyo dahil dito. Others will not like this and leave and join someone else. Those might join, for example, a guild where there is no training, no newbies are accepted and everyone plays at around the same level and the leader curses and yells at the members when they do something wrong, calling it tough love. Some members will leave because of this and join the first guild, others will like the bootcamp style ordering around stay in this guild. Both are pvp guilds. Another example for the pvp guild would be the seemingly random BYOB guild that focuses heavily on activity. Something is -always- happening. The BYOB nature of the guild means new techniques may be discovered but it also means it will lose a lot of matches because.. BYOB. (Bring Your Own Build) \n Another (probably better) explanation of what I mean with \"how\" is.. How do you handle internal conflicts? They -will- happen. My guild, The Order of the Black Lion investigates conflicts by taking everyone separate. Mayroon kaming isang tinukoy na pamamaraan para dito. Other guilds put all parties together and work it out by talking. We separate and work it out based on facts we get. We then do psychological mumbojumbo and fix stuff. Some guilds trust the older member over the newer member or trust higher ranked officers over lower ranked members. That works too. Not sure if it works well, but it works. I'm biased towards keeping everyone same level. Oh and regarding officers... This too is all about the -how- and the personality and signature of your guild. How do you pick officers? What are your officers for? Some guilds give officer positions to the first 10 members who join. I've never joined or had any dealing with those types of guilds so I don't know how effective that is (ahem). Other guilds have the officers be personal friends of the guild leader. It makes sense for the leader to make his friends officers because he knows them and can \"trust\" them. But not everyone who is a friend is a good officer. In my guild, officer positions are temporary job-like positions given to people who do the thing we expect the officer to do anyway or are capable of doing it. Some guilds have their officers be long time members or members who are good at what they do etc. Another thing: the leader. What you do is PvP. How you manage stuff, how you do things is what defines what the guild is like. Change the leader to someone else and the guild changes fundamentally. The leader is the foundation. You set the identity, you set what the guild does. Members will come and go but the ones who identify with your guild are the ones who will stay, the ones who don't, will leave. And that is ok. \n Because of this, you are the guardian, the one who safeguards the guild, the one who leads its progression. Basically the one who leads. Obviously.

Siyempre may ilang mga paghihirap sa engineering at ekolohiya ngunit talagang, pumunta kami sa buwan 50 taon na ang nakalilipas! today we have robots that can learn and are able to see peoples thoughts, we built a 828 meter high tower. surely we should be able to build fishfarms.

{"input_text": "Well, lets see. I got tormented every morning in PE by some skank (who we'll call Jenny) who \"Just didn't like me\" She proceeded to try to make me her \"bitch\" (give her my things to \"borrow\", tell me to do things for her) and after I refused, proceeded to convince people that I was talking shit about them. Now considering she was fairly well known, she managed to turn a lot of people against me. Συμπεριλαμβανομένης αυτής της τεράστιας που μόλις γνώρισα (που θα την ονομάσω Κέλι). One thing leads to another and Kelly, who is HUGE, wants to fight me. Kelly threatens to stab me, gathers a hoard of people to jump me, and approaches me in a passing period. My friend who was with me, who also knew Kelly, tried to talk to her, and explain that she was being lied to, but Kelly's trailer trash cousin hit my buddy and they got into it before any actually discussion took place. Τελικά, όλοι μας αναστολήθηκαν, εγώ, ο φίλος μου, η Τζένι, η Κέλι και η τρελή ξαδέρφη της. I ended up changing schools. My mom thought it was ludicrous that I was suspended for literally not doing anything, and its turned out to be the best decision we've ever made. And Kelly's cousin went to juvie right after!

{"input_text": "On the face of it, yeah, 700 grams is a lot. Ngunit hindi ko iniisip na ito'y kinakailangan na masamang gaya ng iniisip mo. Sa katunayan, kung ikaw ay nasaktan sa krimen na may kaugnayan sa droga, malamang na ikaw ay pabor sa mga casual user stock na kumikita sa paligid na maraming... You're not going to use 700 grams all at once, so that volume has to be judged by consumption rate and accessibility of resupply. That resin  might be his absolute primo stash that he dips into on rare occasion, and if he can only resupply every 3 years....  Basically, for some smokers (all day, erry day, amiright? ), 700 gramo ay maaaring 'magkano lamang' at pagkatapos ay ganap na matagumpay sa mga kalakalan ng droga sa loob ng mahabang panahon. Which brings me back to crime: since we can't keep even drugs out of super max prisons, let's work under the assumption that people are still going to be able to score on occasion. Do we want lots of drug transactions with lots of hard to prosecute interactions, easy cash flow, and low costs of entry to the market combined with high investigatory costs? Or do we want an industry that requires deep pockets to play around in (providing legal surface area and related assets), is continually dealing in significant volumes (minimizing the number of players), and with a minimum number of targets to legislate, investigate, and regulate all while having a more predictable supply to minimize market opportunity to new entrants? Smokers going out and scoring here and there keeps the drug war broad and wide, and punishes responsible users who get hit with disproportionate penalties for living their lives in a more law abiding manner. At ang tanging upside ay mas maraming mga drug dealer na umiiral sa isang mas madali, mas kapaki-pakinabang, merkado. Home or regional growers supplying large volumes of nationally grown weed to residential users for personal use (through the mail for example), would be indistinguishable from our current drug  use  situation, but would give us a fighting chance to eliminate the violent crime aspect of prohibition. It also provides a reasonable framework for full taxation and national price competition (putting unsustainable cost pressure on illegal dealers), and can even be extended (through NAFTA), to deny  billions  of dollars every year to central and south american crime syndicates.", "summary_text": "middle aged white dudes who aren't sketching around in back alleys but blaze like a motherfucker when they come back from the office are gonna be prone to stockpile.

{"input_text": "Я обнаружил, что низкоклассные толпы, в частности, сотники и мародеры, кажется, постоянно колеблются, когда они находятся в радиусе Сингулярности. The chip damage and the stagger provides time enough for me to get shots off with the Hurricane. This tactic is sufficient enough for me to deal with general enemies. But I agree to a point. The Singularity-Adept really can't bank on priming and detonating their own explosions. They  can  self-detonate, but it requires the player to operate within a terrifying and narrow margin of error. As a duder who isn't very good at video games, that's probably not a square deal. I love the new Singularity Adept much in the same way I like the Paladin. I'm now a de facto shield stripper. 200+ damage p/second isn't monumental on Gold, but that chip damage plus the overwhelming assault from a Hurricane slotted with Disruptor Ammo helps the Adept soften the front lines up. Shockwave can stagger pretty much everything, and Warp is there to really hurt the armored guys. Maybe I'm in the minority on this, but I always found the Human Adept to be dependent on other strong power users. Singularity wasn't useful in my playstyle before, but is easier to incorporate as a support-type now.", "summary_text": "I don't know that I agree or disagree but I think I want to cobble together some other perspectives before diving headlong into a conclusion.", "translated_sentences": [0], "translated_to": "Russian"}
