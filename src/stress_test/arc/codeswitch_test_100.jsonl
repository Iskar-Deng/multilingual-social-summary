Here are two sections from the Wikipedia entry on crime in Greece.\n\nOrganized crime[edit]\nSee also: Greek mafia\nOrganized crime in Greece is on the rise.[3] Domestic as well as foreign criminal groups are well-entrenched in Greek society. Traditionally, people associated with organized crime were known as Men of the night (\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bd\u03cd\u03c7\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2). Out of the foreign criminal groups the Albanian mafia is the most prevalent. The activities of the Albanian crime groups in Greece include drug trafficking, human trafficking, extortion and robbery among others.\n\nAlbanian criminal groups often extort other immigrants to Greece, especially Middle Eastern and Pakistani shopkeepers, and control many nightclubs in the working-class districts of West Athens. Russian groups are less numerous, but they are very heavily armed and dangerous; they are involved in arms trafficking, extortion and cigarette smuggling. Lower-level Romanian and Moldavian groups are involved in theft and human trafficking.[4]\n\nImmigrant crime[edit]\nFurther information: Immigration to Greece\nOfficial statistics show that immigrants are responsible for about half of the criminal activity in Greece.[6] The Greek police have admitted that armed gangs entering the country from neighbouring Albania or Bulgaria could have been attracted by reports that many people have been withdrawing cash from banks and stashing it in their homes.[6] There are possibly more than 1 million illegal immigrants inside Greece as of 2012.[6][7] Cases of immigrant crime such as the 2012 Paros rape have attracted nationwide interest.\n\nIllegal immigration to Greece has increased rapidly over the past several years. Tough immigration policies in Spain and Italy and agreements with their neighboring African countries to combat illegal immigration have changed the direction of African immigration flows toward Greece. At the same time, flows from Asia and the Middle East \u2014 mainly Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Bangladesh \u2014 to Greece appear to have increased as well.[7]","tokens":["\u2581I","\u2581am","\u2581","aware","\u2581of","\u2581Ar","van","ites","\u2581and","\u2581the","y","\u2581have","\u2581been","\u2581here","\u2581for","\u2581","thousand","s","\u2581of","\u2581years",",","\u2581I","'","m","\u2581not","\u2581debat","ing","\u2581","racial","\u2581pur","ity","\u2581or","\u2581","anything",",","\u2581","i","'","m","\u2581say","ing","\u2581the","\u2581last","\u2581wave","\u2581was","\u2581dis","pro","portion","ately","\u2581","responsible","\u2581for","\u2581crime","\u2581in","\u2581","Greece",".","\u2581Here","\u2581are","\u2581two","\u2581","sections","\u2581from","\u2581the","\u2581Wikipedia","\u2581entry","\u2581on","\u2581crime","\u2581in","\u2581","Greece",".","\u2581Organiz","ed","\u2581crime","[","edit","]","\u2581See","\u2581also",":","\u2581","Greek","\u2581","mafia","\u2581Organiz","ed","\u2581crime","\u2581in","\u2581","Greece","\u2581is","\u2581on","\u2581the","\u2581rise",".[3]","\u2581","Domestic","\u2581as","\u2581well","\u2581as","\u2581","foreign","\u2581criminal","\u2581groups","\u2581are","\u2581well","-","entre","nched","\u2581in","\u2581","Greek","\u2581","society",".","\u2581","Traditional","ly",",","\u2581people","\u2581","associated","\u2581with","\u2581organiz","ed","\u2581crime","\u2581were","\u2581","known","\u2581as","\u2581Men","\u2581of","\u2581the","\u2581night","\u2581(","\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf","\u03b9","\u2581\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2","\u2581","\u03bd","\u03cd\u03c7","\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2",").","\u2581Out","\u2581of","\u2581the","\u2581","foreign","\u2581criminal","\u2581groups","\u2581the","\u2581Albani","an","\u2581","mafia","\u2581is","\u2581the","\u2581most","\u2581pre","valent",".","\u2581The","\u2581activities","\u2581of","\u2581the","\u2581Albani","an","\u2581crime","\u2581groups","\u2581in","\u2581","Greece","\u2581include","\u2581drug","\u2581traffic","king",",","\u2581human","\u2581traffic","king",",","\u2581ex","tor","tion","\u2581and","\u2581robb","ery","\u2581","among","\u2581others",".","\u2581Albani","an","\u2581criminal","\u2581groups","\u2581","often","\u2581ex","tor","t","\u2581other","\u2581","immigrant","s","\u2581to","\u2581","Greece",",","\u2581","especially","\u2581Middle","\u2581","Eastern","\u2581and","\u2581Pakistan","i","\u2581shop","keeper","s",",","\u2581and","\u2581control","\u2581many","\u2581night","clubs","\u2581in","\u2581the","\u2581working","-","class","\u2581district","s","\u2581of","\u2581West","\u2581Athens",".","\u2581Russian","\u2581groups","\u2581are","\u2581less","\u2581numero","us",",","\u2581but","\u2581the","y","\u2581are","\u2581","very","\u2581hea","vily","\u2581","armed","\u2581and","\u2581","dangerous",";","\u2581the","y","\u2581are","\u2581","involved","\u2581in","\u2581","arms","\u2581traffic","king",",","\u2581ex","tor","tion","\u2581and","\u2581","cigarette","\u2581","smug","gling",".","\u2581","Lower","-","level","\u2581","Romanian","\u2581and","\u2581Mold","avia","n","\u2581groups","\u2581are","\u2581","involved","\u2581in","\u2581the","ft","\u2581and","\u2581human","\u2581traffic","king",".[4]","\u2581Im","migrant","\u2581crime","[","edit","]","\u2581F","urther","\u2581information",":","\u2581I","mmigration","\u2581to","\u2581","Greece","\u2581","Official","\u2581","statistics","\u2581show","\u2581that","\u2581","immigrant","s","\u2581are","\u2581","responsible","\u2581for","\u2581about","\u2581half","\u2581of","\u2581the","\u2581criminal","\u2581activity","\u2581in","\u2581","Greece",".[6]","\u2581The","\u2581","Greek","\u2581police","\u2581have","\u2581ad","mitted","\u2581that","\u2581","armed","\u2581","gangs","\u2581","entering","\u2581the","\u2581country","\u2581from","\u2581","neighbour","ing","\u2581","Albania","\u2581or","\u2581Bulgaria","\u2581","could","\u2581have","\u2581been","\u2581attract","ed","\u2581by","\u2581","reports","\u2581that","\u2581many","\u2581people","\u2581have","\u2581been","\u2581with","drawing","\u2581cash","\u2581from","\u2581banks","\u2581and","\u2581sta","shing","\u2581it","\u2581in","\u2581","their","\u2581homes",".[6]","\u2581There","\u2581are","\u2581possibl","y","\u2581more","\u2581than","\u25811","\u2581million","\u2581","illegal","\u2581","immigrant","s","\u2581inside","\u2581","Greece","\u2581as","\u2581of","\u25812012",".[6]","[7]","\u2581Case","s","\u2581of","\u2581","immigrant","\u2581crime","\u2581such","\u2581as","\u2581the","\u25812012","\u2581Par","os","\u2581rape","\u2581have","\u2581attract","ed","\u2581nation","wide","\u2581interest",".","\u2581Il","legal","\u2581","immigration","\u2581to","\u2581","Greece","\u2581has","\u2581in","creased","\u2581rapid","ly","\u2581over","\u2581the","\u2581past","\u2581se","veral","\u2581years",".","\u2581T","ough","\u2581","immigration","\u2581","policies","\u2581in","\u2581Spain","\u2581and","\u2581Italy","\u2581and","\u2581","agreement","s","\u2581with","\u2581","their","\u2581neighbor","ing","\u2581African","\u2581countries","\u2581to","\u2581combat","\u2581","illegal

{"Lang1":"English","Lang2":"Greek","Text":"Do you have daily limits for spending with debit\/credit cards? You can get money from \"spending\" too, here's how the scheme works:\n\nSince cash in Greece is constrained right now, you'll have to get money from other countries. For example, drive to the nearest foreign city and go into any random shop and ask the clerk if you can use your credit\/debit card **as if** you would buy a product\/service but that in reality you only want him to give you cash. Some merchants may accept on a 10\/20% discount. Why would you accept a discount? Because maybe losing 10\/20% of your money is better than losing 50\/80% of your **if and only if** the government decides to make its own currency and convert all national bank euro deposits to that new currency. Another reason would be the immediate necessity of cash, that's the markup you'd be paying.\n\nAnother way, which I think is best, is try getting to (once again) \"spend\" money to any relatives with a foreign Paypal account for example and using your card to pay.

{"Lang1":"English","Lang2":"Greek","Text":"But my point is that it's *not* just corruption and tax dodging. Greece's economy was basically an inverted pyramid that grew and grew and sooner or later had to come crashing down. Almost 25% of their workers worked for the government at some point. Basically every family had one or more public sector workers, and they were exempt from being fired by constitutional rights. The reason this was allowed to happen was of course the lies of PASOK about Greece's budgetary problems, but that party was in power almost continuously since the 80s. At that point it's fair to say that it's as much a societal as a political \/ corruptional problem.
