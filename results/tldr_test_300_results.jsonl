{"prediction": "<extra_id_0> a throwaway account.", "reference": "it was just a physical thing and we never went on a \"real\" date.  Now that I'm a bit older, a bit heavier (not clinically obese), I'm sort of starting to think it's a bit too late in that area - I don't know that I'm much of a catch anymore, plus the pool of good women has significantly decreased with most of the reasonable age bracket being already married, overly complicated, or just plain crazy (kidding on that last point).  If I ended up settling on someone just to not be alone, it wouldn't really be fair to her, nor myself. \n My family's not that close - sure they'd be hurt if I was gone, but they'll get over it.  My group of friends has always been rather small, but again, we're not that close. \n I'm just not really sure what reason there is for me to live, aside from taking up space and using up our planet's resources - which slightly nudges the needle from being right between wanting to live and wanting to die, towards wanting to die.  I could go back to work, buy a nice house with giant tv and whatever other stuff people say you need to be happy, but to what end? \n In thinking about a way to leave, I do want to minimize any negative effects on others (whether it be emotional/physical/convenience/etc) as well as myself, and I've finally thought of a way to do so.  I won't go in to any detail, but as far as I can see, it wouldn't definitively look like suicide, which would hopefully lessen any loss felt by others."}
